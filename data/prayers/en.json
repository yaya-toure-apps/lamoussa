From now on also, I ask You to sustain with Your grace those who would have the thankless task of helping me.\n\nIf, one day, illness should invade my brain and annihilate my lucidity, already, Lord, my submission is before You and will continue in silent adoration.\n\nIf, one day, a state of prolonged unconsciousness should overcome me, I want each of these hours that I will have to live to be an uninterrupted succession of acts of thanksgiving and that my last sigh be also a sigh of love.

You know what I hope for from your intercession, (specify here, in whatever terms you wish, the favor you desire). Saint Philomena, in whom the holy Cur\u00e9 of Ars placed all his confidence, I too have confidence in you!\nSaint Philomena, virgin and martyr, pray for us.\n\nOur Father..., Hail Mary..., Glory be...\n\nFirst Day\nIn thought, O Saint Philomena, I descend into that Roman catacomb where your sacred remains have remained buried for centuries. I venerate those relics of a Virgin martyr of the early Church, then I read on the three bricks that closed your tomb this sweet inscription: PAX TECUM FILUMENA! PEACE BE WITH YOU, DAUGHTER OF LIGHT. Saint Philomena, your name means Beloved. Yes, in truth, your early virtues, your virginal purity, your courage in sacrifice have earned you here below, even before being in Heaven, one of those souls whom Jesus loved particularly. And now, after your bloody immolation, you rest in peace, in eternal peace!\nO Saint Philomena, obtain for me to flee sin, to remain in the grace of God, and thus to always possess the peace of a good conscience, so that I myself may have a privileged place in the Heart of my God.\n\nSecond Day\nO Saint Philomena, it was only at the dawn of the nineteenth century that your humble tomb emerged, as if by chance, from oblivion. Until then, your very existence and name had been ignored. How did your life on earth unfold? We do not know. We only know that it ended in a few years, and that it was as humble as your tomb.\nOh! The hidden life, the modest and obscure life, how you highlight it in the eyes of the Christian! It is the life of Jesus in Nazareth and it was yours, sweet Virgin martyr. Teach me to appreciate and love it. Make me despise and flee, as they deserve, the vanities of a guilty world. That, following your example, I may apply myself to my duties of state, however humble, however laborious they may be, so that in fulfilling them, I too may accomplish the divine Will.\n\nThird Day\nO Saint Philomena, the Church has bestowed upon you the title of Virgin. You were immolated in the springtime of your life, and you remained pure in the midst of a corrupt and corrupting pagan world. You are like a beautiful bloodied lily whose fragrance, crossing the ages, has reached us. Was it not even your love of virginity that made you so generously accept martyrdom?\nAre the times in which we live, O little Saint, less evil than those in which you lived? To how many dangers are believing souls exposed! Keep me in the midst of this world. Give me at the same time the love of prayer which wards off perils and which, as your holy friend the Cur\u00e9 of Ars said, \"makes a pure soul all-powerful over the so good Heart of Our Lord\".\n\nFourth Day\nO Saint Philomena, with the title of Virgin, the Church has bestowed upon you the title of Martyr. This palm, painted on your tomb, proves indeed that you have given to Jesus Christ the supreme testimony of love. At thirteen years old, you left the earth, when life smiled upon you, full of promises; but to avoid death it would have been necessary to deny God, and you did not want to.\nHoly martyr, you teach us the worth of our soul and how precious is the treasure of our faith. You also teach us that we must endure everything, suffer everything rather than abandon our religious practices and obedience to the laws of the Church. Obtain for me strength in trials, in sorrows, in illnesses, with the courage to make, for the love of God, all the necessary sacrifices.\n\nFifth Day\nO Saint Philomena, it is in the sanctuary of Mugnano, in Italy, that you first manifested your benevolent power. Hardly were your precious remains honored there than the miracles due to your intercession multiplied. It was at the foot of your reliquary that was healed, in particular, a dying woman brought from France, the very one who had founded in Lyon the admirable work of the Propagation of the Faith. This healing led the Sovereign Pontiff Gregory XVI to approve your already widespread cult. \"She is a great saint,\" Pope Leo XII had already said of you.\nYes, O beloved of Christ, we believe it, you are truly a great Saint. A village in the land of France, Ars, has also been the witness of your prodigies. Your power has not diminished. You have been called a \"little Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the early Church\": like your angelic sister, do you not spend your Heaven doing good on earth?\n\nSixth Day\nO Saint Philomena, for thirty years, a priest of France whom the Church has canonized, the Cur\u00e9 of Ars, never ceased to invoke you and to have you invoked. He called you his dear little Saint, his consul, his business agent with God. It is through you that Saint John Mary Vianney obtained from God countless graces and miracles. At his request you healed bodies, you converted souls. In truth, you seemed to obey him like a child to his father.\nA fervent prayer, O sweet Virgin Martyr, always finds its way to your heart. That is why, inspired by the example of the holy Cur\u00e9 of Ars, I insist with you. You sometimes put his patience to the test. If you want to test my Faith, give me, with perseverance in prayer, the confident assurance that God, prayed to by you, will grant me the best grace.\n\nSeventh Day\nO Saint Philomena, it is told in the life of the holy Cur\u00e9 of Ars that you appeared to him to comfort him in the midst of the struggles he had to sustain against hell. You \"descended to him from Heaven, beautiful and luminous,\" bringing him a reflection of the divine splendors. Did he not say in his simple language: \"With the Blessed Virgin and Saint Philomena, we know each other well\"?\nValiant martyr, I too desire to know you well, you and the Blessed Virgin who crushes the head of the infernal serpent. Satan multiplies assaults against baptized souls; he especially wants the souls of the smallest. O little saint of the Cur\u00e9 of Ars, render his rage powerless. Give me an ever greater horror of sin, so that it may have no dominion over me. Strengthen me in the midst of temptations and give me victory.\n\nEighth Day\nO Saint Philomena, the Truths of the Gospel would gradually disappear from the world if, from time to time, it did not show them to us living in a soul full of Faith. At the exit of the great revolution which accumulated so many ruins, you were like the messenger of God and the apostle of the supernatural. In many souls your prodigies have rekindled or revived Faith.\nYour mission, O Virgin of Christ, is not yet finished. The desire for pleasures, evil passions, perverse doctrines, the impious and immoral press have wreaked havoc in too many souls of our time and our country. Criminals have striven to drive the consoling religion from the hearts of the humble and the little ones. Combat, I beg you, their perverse action; make me myself exercise around me a Christian and salutary influence.\n\nNinth Day\nO Saint Philomena, after the trials of the earth, after the torments of martyrdom, up there you rest in peace. You enjoy the endless vision of God whom you have loved so much. Of all your pains, of all your sufferings, there remains only the joy of having accepted them generously and an eternal glory. How happy you are!\nFor me, it is still exile far from the house of our Father. See the gaze of my heart directed towards you. Hear my fervent prayer. This novena will not end without me begging you, O sweet and powerful Philomena, to continue your help and your protection. Through you, I implore the final grace, the happiness of contemplating, with you and the holy Cur\u00e9 of Ars, Him who makes in Heaven the eternal delights of the elect.\n\nPrayers\nIllustrious virgin and martyr, blessed Saint Philomena, whose name and miracles are known to the ends of the earth, be sensitive to my confidence in your intercession, and to the desire I have to see your cult spread throughout the universe. Glorious virgin and martyr, I rejoice with you in the power that the Lord has given you, for the glory of His name and for the edification of His Church. I love to see you so pure, so generous, so faithful to Jesus, so elevated in glory.\nDrawn by your examples to the practice of virtue, full of hope at the sight of the rewards granted to your merits, I want to flee sin, and accomplish all that God commands me. Help me, great Saint, to obtain a purity forever inviolable, a generosity that refuses no sacrifice for the love of God, a boundless devotion to the Catholic faith, and... (name the special favor you desire). This God so good for whom you gave your blood and your life, this God who has loved me so much, will refuse nothing to your prayers.\nAmen\n\nI greet you, O innocent Philomena, who, through the love of Jesus, have preserved in all its splendor the lily of virginity. I greet you, O illustrious Philomena, who have so courageously shed your blood for Jesus Christ.\nI bless the Lord for all the graces He has granted you during your life, and especially at the hour of your death. I praise Him and glorify Him for the honor and the power with which He has crowned you, and I beg you to obtain for me from God the graces that I ask through your intercession.\nSaint Philomena, beloved daughter of Jesus and Mary, pray for us who have recourse to you.\nAmen\n","en_html":null,"copy":null,"author":null,"email":null,"source":"0"},{"id":"203","category_id":"5","en_title":"Prayer to Obtain a Special Grace Through the Intercession of Saint Anne\n","en_content":"O glorious Saint Anne, full of goodness for all who invoke you, full of compassion for all who suffer, finding myself overwhelmed with anxieties and sorrows, I cast myself at your feet, humbly beseeching you to take under your guidance the matter which occupies me.
