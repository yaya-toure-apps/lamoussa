            &nbsp;«&amp;nbsp;Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother to be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This mystery is of great import:&amp;nbsp;I mean that it applies to Christ and the Church&amp;nbsp;» (Eph 5:31-32). This text from the letter to the Ephesians (...) compares the nuptial character of the love between man and woman with the mystery of Christ and the Church. Christ is the Bridegroom of the Church, the Church is the Bride of Christ. This analogy is not without precedent:&amp;nbsp;it transposes into the New Testament what was already contained in the Old Testament, particularly among the prophets Hosea, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah (Hos 1:2; 2:16-18; Jer 2:2; Ezek 16:8; Isa 50:1; 54:5-8). (...) Among the prophets, this woman-bride is Israel as the people chosen by God, and this election has its source solely in God&#039;s gratuitous love. It is precisely by this love that the covenant is explained, often presented as a nuptial covenant that God constantly renews with his chosen people. It is, on God&#039;s part, a lasting commitment:&amp;nbsp;he remains faithful to his spousal love, even if the bride has shown herself unfaithful many times.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            This image of spousal love linked to the figure of the divine Bridegroom — a very clear image in the prophetic texts —&amp;nbsp;; is confirmed and crowned in the letter to the Ephesians (...) where the strongest expression of the truth about the love of Christ the Redeemer is found, following the analogy of nuptial love in marriage:&amp;nbsp;«&amp;nbsp;Christ loved the Church:&amp;nbsp;he gave himself up for her&amp;nbsp;» (5:25). In this, the fact that the Church is the Bride of Christ is fully confirmed:&amp;nbsp;«&amp;nbsp;The Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer&amp;nbsp;» (Is 54:5). In the text of Saint Paul, the analogy of the nuptial relationship simultaneously takes two directions that form the whole of the «&amp;nbsp;great mystery&amp;nbsp;» («&amp;nbsp;sacramentum magnum&amp;nbsp;»). The covenant properly so-called of the spouses explains the spousal character of the union of Christ and the Church;&amp;nbsp;and this union, in turn, as a «&amp;nbsp;great sacrament,&amp;nbsp;» determines the sacramentality of marriage as a holy covenant of the two spouses, man and woman.<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">1:15-20.</font>@@@@@Christ is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation:<br /><br />
for in him were created all things in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether Powers, Principalities, Sovereignties, Dominations, all things were created through him and for him.<br /><br />
He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.<br /><br />
He is also the head of the body, the head of the Church: he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.<br /><br />
For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him<br /><br />
and through him to reconcile all things to himself, making peace by the blood of his Cross, peace for all beings on earth and in heaven.<br />

come before him with joyful song.<br /><br />
Know that the Lord is God.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It is he who made us, and we are his;<br /><br />
we are his people, the flock he tends.<br /><br />
Enter his gates with thanksgiving,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
his courts with praise.<br /><br />
Give thanks to him; bless his name,<br /><br />
For the Lord is good;<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">5:33-39.</font>@@@@@At that time, the Pharisees and the scribes said to Jesus, « The disciples of John the Baptist fast often and offer prayers; and so do those of the Pharisees. But yours eat and drink! »<br /><br />
Jesus said to them, « Can you make the wedding guests fast while the Bridegroom is with them?<br /><br />
But days will come when the Bridegroom is taken away from them; then, in those days, they will fast. »<br /><br />
He also told them a parable: « No one tears a piece from a new garment to sew on an old garment. Otherwise, the new will be torn, and the piece from the new will not match the old.<br /><br />
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled and the wineskins will be ruined.<br /><br />
But new wine must be poured into fresh wineskins.<br /><br />
No one who has drunk old wine desires new. For he says, “The old is good.” »<br />
