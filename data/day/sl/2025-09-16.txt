      No one who is a Christian should doubt that even now, the dead rise again. Of course, everyone has eyes to see people brought back to life, just like the widow's son who was just mentioned in the Gospel. But not everyone can see those who are spiritually dead brought back to life; to see that, you must have already been brought back to life within yourself. It is a greater thing to bring someone back to life who will live forever than to bring back someone who will die again.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      The young man's mother, the widow, was filled with joy to see her son brought back to life. Our mother, the Church, also rejoices every day when she sees her children brought back to life spiritually. The widow's son had died physically; but these others had died spiritually. People shed tears over the visible death of the first, but no one worried about the invisible death of the others; in fact, no one even saw it. The only one who wasn't indifferent was the one who knew these dead people; only the one who could give them life knew them. Indeed, if the Lord had not come to bring the dead back to life, the Apostle Paul would not have said: “Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you!” (Ephesians 5:14)<br />

First Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to Timothy <font dir="ltr">3:1-13.</font>@@@@@Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone desires to be a leader in the church, it is a noble task they want.<br /><br />
A leader must be faultless, husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,<br /><br />
not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.<br /><br />
He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a dignified way.<br /><br />
For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he take care of God's church?<br /><br />
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same condemnation as the devil.<br /><br />
He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.<br /><br />
Deacons likewise must be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.<br /><br />
They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.<br /><br />
They must first be tested; then, if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.<br /><br />
Their wives likewise must be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.<br /><br />
A deacon must be the husband of one wife and must manage his children and his own family well.<br /><br />
Those who have served well as deacons gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">101:1-2a, 2b-3a, 5, 6.</font>@@@@@I will sing of your justice and kindness;<br /><br />
I will sing praises to you, O Lord!<br /><br />
I will walk on the blameless path;<br /><br />
oh, when will you come to me?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I will walk with a blameless heart<br /><br />
within my house;<br /><br />
I will not set my eyes<br /><br />
on anything wicked.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret,<br /><br />
I will put to silence;<br /><br />
whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart,<br /><br />
I will not tolerate.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
My eyes will look for the faithful in the land,<br /><br />
that they may live with me;<br /><br />
whoever walks blamelessly<br /><br />
will minister to me.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">7:11-17.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him.<br /><br />
As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the town was with her.<br /><br />
When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, “Don’t cry.”<br /><br />
He went up and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, “Young man, I tell you, get up!”<br /><br />
The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.<br /><br />
They were all filled with awe and praised God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us!” and “God has come to help his people.”<br /><br />
This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.<br />
