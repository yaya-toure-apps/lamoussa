<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">« Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find »</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      I know well, God, all-powerful Father: my main duty in life is to offer myself to you, so that everything I am... speaks of you. You gave me the gift of speech, and it can bring me no greater reward than the honor of serving you and showing the world—those who don't know you, and those who deny you—who you are: the Father of God's only Son. Yes, truly, this is my only wish! But I greatly need to ask for your merciful help, so that, with the breath of your Spirit, you will fill the sails of my faith, stretched out for you, and move me to preach your holy name everywhere. For you did not make this promise in vain: « Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you ». 
      As poor ones, we ask for what we lack. We will eagerly study your prophets and apostles; we will knock on every door that our understanding finds closed. But only you can answer our prayer...; only you can open the door we knock on. You will encourage our difficult beginnings; you will strengthen our progress; and you will call us to share in the Spirit that guided your prophets and apostles. This way, we will not give their words a meaning different from what they intended.
      So, give us the true meaning of words, the light of understanding, beautiful expression, and faith in truth. Let us say what we believe...: that there is only one God, the Father, and one Lord, Jesus Christ.<br />

Book of Malachi <font dir="ltr">3:13-20a.</font>@@@@@« You have spoken harsh words against me, – says the Lord. And you dare to ask: “What have we said among ourselves against you?”<br /><br />
Here is what you said: “Serving God is useless. What good is it to keep his rules, or live a joyless life before the Lord of all?<br /><br />
We even say that the proud are blessed; those who do evil succeed, and even when they test God, they get away with it!” »<br /><br />
Then those who feared the Lord spoke to each other. The Lord listened carefully. A book was written before him to remember them, for those who feared him and cared about his name.<br /><br />
The Lord of all declared: « They will be my special treasure on the day I prepare. I will be kind to them, just as a father is kind to his son who serves him faithfully.<br /><br />
You will see again the difference between good people and bad people, between those who serve God and those who refuse to serve him.<br /><br />
Look, the day of the Lord is coming, burning like an oven. All the proud, all who do evil, will be like straw. The coming day will burn them up, – says the Lord of all –, leaving them no root or branch.<br /><br />
But for you who fear my name, the Sun of Justice will rise: it will bring healing in its light. »<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">1:1-2, 3, 4, 6.</font>@@@@@Blessed is the person <br /><br />
who does not follow the advice of the wicked, <br /><br />
or take the path of sinners, <br /><br />
or sit with mockers,<br /><br />
but finds joy in the law of the Lord <br /><br />
and thinks about his law day and night!
They are like a tree <br /><br />
planted by streams of water, <br /><br />
which gives fruit in its season, <br /><br />
and its leaves never die; <br /><br />
everything they do will succeed.<br /><br />
This is not how it is for the wicked. 
But they are like straw <br /><br />
blown away by the wind:<br /><br />
The Lord knows the way of the righteous, <br /><br />
but the way of the wicked will vanish.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to St. Luke <font dir="ltr">11:5-13.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus told his disciples: « Imagine one of you has a friend and goes to him in the middle of the night to ask: “My friend, lend me three loaves of bread,<br /><br />
because a friend of mine has arrived from a trip to my house, and I have nothing to offer him.”<br /><br />
And if, from inside, the other answers him: “Don’t bother me! The door is already shut; my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.”<br /><br />
Well, I tell you: even if he won’t get up to give out of friendship, he will get up because of the friend’s boldness, and give him everything he needs.<br /><br />
I tell you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.<br /><br />
For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.<br /><br />
Which father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish?<br /><br />
Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?<br /><br />
So if you, who are sinful, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” »<br />
