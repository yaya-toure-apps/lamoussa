<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“The Twelve accompanied him, as did some women.”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
             “If you knew the gift of God” (John 4:10), Jesus told the Samaritan woman during one of his wonderful talks. These talks show his great respect for the dignity of every woman and for the calling that allows each one to take part in his mission as the Messiah. (…) The Church wants to thank the Most Holy Trinity for the “mystery of woman” and for every woman. It thanks God for the eternal part of her feminine dignity, and for the “wonders of God” that, through human history, have been done in and through her. After all, wasn't it in and through women that the greatest event in human history on earth happened—when God himself became man?
             That is why the Church gives thanks for all women and for each one of them: for mothers, for sisters, for wives; for women dedicated to God in virginity; for women who give their lives to many people waiting for the free love of another; for women who care for people in the family, that main sign of human community; for women who work in a profession, those who sometimes carry great social responsibility. (...)
             The Church gives thanks for all the ways women's unique talents have shown up throughout history, in all peoples and nations. It gives thanks for all the gifts (charisms) that the Holy Spirit has given to women in the history of God’s People. (…) The Church also asks that these priceless “manifestations of the Spirit” (1 Cor 12:4s) (…) be carefully recognized and valued. This is so they can contribute to the common good of the Church and humanity.<br />

First Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to Timothy <font dir="ltr">6:2c-12.</font>@@@@@Dear friend, this is what you must teach and strongly advise.<br /><br />
If anyone teaches different things and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the teaching that leads to godliness,<br /><br />
such a person is blinded by pride. They know nothing. They are sick with arguing and quarrels over words. From all this come only envy, disagreement, insults, and bad suspicions,<br /><br />
endless disputes among people whose minds are corrupt and who have lost the truth. They think that godliness is a way to get rich.<br /><br />
Indeed, there is great profit in godliness if one is content with what they have.<br /><br />
Just as we brought nothing into this world, we can take nothing out of it.<br /><br />
If we have food and clothing, let us be content with that.<br /><br />
Those who want to get rich fall into temptation, into many foolish and harmful desires that sink people into ruin and destruction.<br /><br />
For the love of money is the root of all evil. Some people, wanting money too much, have wandered away from the faith and have caused themselves many pains.<br /><br />
But you, man of God, flee from all this. Instead, seek after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.<br /><br />
Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of eternal life, to which you were called when you made your good confession in front of many witnesses.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">49(48):6-7, 8-9, 17-18, 19-20.</font>@@@@@Why should I be afraid in times of trouble,<br /><br />
when wicked people close in on me,<br /><br />
those who trust in their wealth<br /><br />
and boast of their great riches?
No one can buy back another person<br /><br />
or pay God a ransom for them:<br /><br />
no matter how much they pay,<br /><br />
all life must end.
Do not be afraid when a person gets rich,<br /><br />
when the splendor of their house increases:<br /><br />
for when they die, they take nothing with them;<br /><br />
their glory does not follow them down.
While alive, they bless themselves:<br /><br />
“People praise you when things go well for you!”<br /><br />
But they will join the line of their ancestors,<br /><br />
who will never again see the light.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">8:1-3.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus traveled through towns and villages, preaching and telling the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,<br /><br />
and also some women who had been healed of diseases and evil spirits: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out,<br /><br />
Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s household manager; Susanna; and many other women who provided for them out of their own means.<br />
