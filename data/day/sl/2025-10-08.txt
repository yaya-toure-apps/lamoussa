<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">« Father, hallowed be your name! »</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            The expression “God the Father” had never been revealed to anyone. When Moses himself asked God who he was, he heard a different name. To us, this name was revealed in the Son. For this name implies the new name of Father. «&amp;nbsp;I have come in my Father’s name&amp;nbsp;» (Jn 5:43). And elsewhere&amp;nbsp;: «&amp;nbsp;Father, glorify your name&amp;nbsp;» (Jn 12:28)&amp;nbsp;; and even more explicitly&amp;nbsp;: «&amp;nbsp;I have made your name known to people&amp;nbsp;» (Jn 17:6). We therefore ask him&amp;nbsp;: «&amp;nbsp;Hallowed be your name&amp;nbsp;».
            It's not that we should make wishes for God, as if we could wish him something, or as if he would be missing something without our wishes. Instead, we must bless God always and everywhere, to show the gratitude every person owes for his good deeds. Blessing fulfills this duty. Besides, how could God's name not always be holy and hallowed in itself, since it makes others holy? And the army of angels surrounding him never ceases to say&amp;nbsp;: «&amp;nbsp;Holy, Holy, Holy&amp;nbsp;». And we, who hope to share the angels' happiness, now join our voices with theirs, and practice the part of our future dignity. This is about God's glory.
            Regarding the prayer we make for ourselves, when we say&amp;nbsp;: «&amp;nbsp;Hallowed be your name&amp;nbsp;», we ask that it be made holy in us, who are in him, and also in others whom God's grace is still waiting for, so that we follow the command that tells us to pray for everyone, even our enemies. That is why, by not specifically saying&amp;nbsp;: «&amp;nbsp;Hallowed be your name&amp;nbsp;» in us, we are asking that it be made holy in all people.<br />

Book of Jonah <font dir="ltr">4:1-11.</font>@@@@@When he saw that God had pardoned the inhabitants of Nineveh, Jonah was very displeased and became angry.<br /><br />
He prayed to the Lord: « Ah, Lord! Is not this what I said when I was still in my own country? That is why I fled at first to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and rich in love, and that you relent from punishing.<br /><br />
Now, Lord, please take my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. »<br /><br />
The Lord said to him, « Do you have good reason to be angry? »<br /><br />
Jonah left Nineveh and sat down east of the city. There he made a shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade, to see what would happen to the city.<br /><br />
The Lord God provided a castor oil plant; it grew up over Jonah’s head to give him shade, and relieve him of his discomfort. Jonah was greatly pleased with the plant.<br /><br />
But the next day at dawn, God sent a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered.<br /><br />
At sunrise, God sent a scorching east wind. The sun beat down on Jonah’s head, so that he grew faint. He asked that he might die and said, « It is better for me to die than to live. »<br /><br />
God said to Jonah, « Do you have good reason to be angry about the plant? » He replied, « Yes, I have good reason to be angry enough to wish to die. »<br /><br />
The Lord replied, « You are concerned about the plant, for which you did not labor and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night.<br /><br />
And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, the great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left, besides many animals? »<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">86(85):3-4, 5-6, 9-10.</font>@@@@@Have mercy on me, Lord, <br /><br />
for I call to you all day long.<br /><br />
Lord, bring joy to your servant, <br /><br />
for to you, I lift my soul!
For you, Lord, are good and forgiving, <br /><br />
abounding in steadfast love to all who call on you,<br /><br />
hear my prayer, Lord, <br /><br />
listen to my cry for mercy.
All the nations you have made <br /><br />
will come and worship before you, <br /><br />
and bring glory to your name, Lord,<br /><br />
for you are great and do marvelous deeds, <br /><br />
you alone are God.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">11:1-4.</font>@@@@@It happened that Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, « Lord, teach us to pray, just as John the Baptist taught his disciples. »<br /><br />
He said to them, « When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.<br /><br />
Give us each day our daily bread.<br /><br />
And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation. »<br />
