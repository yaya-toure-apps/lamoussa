<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Vigilant Asceticism of the Just</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            "My spirit is wasted." (Job 17:1 Vg) The spirit wastes away in fear of judgment, because the closer the soul of the elect feels to the supreme judgment, the more it trembles with dread in its examination of conscience, and if it discovers any carnal thoughts within itself, it consumes them in the fire of penance. (...) The elect strikes his breast with all the more penetration as he rigorously awaits the judge, already very near.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Hence it is that the elect believe their end is always near. For if the soul of the reprobate often behaves wickedly, it is because it judges that it has a long time to live in this world. Thus the spirit of the just withers, and that of the unjust is strengthened. By the very fact, indeed, that it swells with pride, it does not know the withering of its spirit. But, considering the brevity of his life, the just turns away from the faults of pride and impurity. Hence this addition: "My days will be shortened, and only the tomb remains for me." He who considers what he will be in death acts always with fear; and already no longer living, so to speak, in his own eyes, he lives in all truth in the eyes of Him who formed him. (...)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            It is in this vigilant asceticism that the just escapes the snares of sin. Hence this word of Scripture: "In all thy works remember thy last end, and thou shalt never sin." (Sirach 7:40 Vg)<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">40:16-21, 34-38.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses executed everything the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
The dwelling of God was erected in the second year after the departure from Egypt, on the first day of the first month.<br /><br />
Moses thus erected the Dwelling: he laid its bases, its frames, and its crossbars, and he set up its pillars.<br /><br />
Above the Dwelling, he spread out the Tent and covered it as the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark. He put its poles into the ark and covered it with the golden plate called the propitiatory.<br /><br />
He brought the ark into the Dwelling, and set up the veil to screen the ark of the Testimony as the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
The cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the Dwelling.<br /><br />
Moses could not enter the tent of meeting, for the cloud remained there and the glory of the Lord filled the Dwelling.<br /><br />
At every stage, when the cloud rose and left the Dwelling, the sons of Israel broke camp.<br /><br />
If the cloud did not rise, they remained camped until the day it rose.<br /><br />
During the day, the cloud of the Lord rested on the Dwelling, and at night, a fire shone in the cloud in the sight of all Israel. And so it was at all their stages.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">84(83):3-4, 5-6, 11.</font>@@@@@My soul yearns with longing <br /><br />for the courts of the Lord;<br /><br />my heart and my flesh cry out<br /><br />to the living God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Even the sparrow has found a home,<br /><br />and the swallow a nest to shelter its young:<br /><br />your altars, Lord of hosts,<br /><br />my King and my God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are those who dwell in your house:<br /><br />they will praise you evermore!<br /><br />Blessed are the men whose strength is in you:<br /><br />pathways open in their hearts!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Indeed, one day in your courts<br /><br />is better than a thousand.<br /><br />I have chosen to stand at the threshold<br /><br />of the house of my God,<br /><br />rather than to dwell among the wicked.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:47-53.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to the crowds: "The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind.<br /><br />
When it was full, they drew it ashore, sat down, and put the good into baskets, but threw out the bad.<br /><br />
So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous<br /><br />
and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."<br /><br />
"Have you understood all this?" They answered, "Yes."<br /><br />
Jesus added, "Therefore, every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."<br /><br />
When Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there.<br />
