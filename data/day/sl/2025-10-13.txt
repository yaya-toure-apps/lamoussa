<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Jonah was a sign to the inhabitants of Nineveh; so will the Son of Man be to this generation.”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      The people of Nineveh fasted with a pure fast when Jonah preached conversion to them. Indeed, it is written: “When they heard Jonah’s preaching, they decreed a perpetual fast and unceasing supplication, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.” They cast off their fine garments and put on sackcloth instead. They denied infants their mothers’ breasts, and small and large livestock their pasture (Jon 3). (...)
      And behold, it is written: “God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways. Then he turned away his wrath from them and did not destroy them.” It does not say: “He saw an abstinence from bread and water, with sackcloth and ashes,” but “that they returned from their evil ways and the wickedness of their deeds.” (...) This was a pure fast, and it was accepted, the fast that the Ninevites kept, when they turned from their evil ways and the rapacity of their hands. (...)
      For, my friend, when one fasts, the abstinence from wickedness is always the best. It is better than abstinence from bread and water, better than (...) “bowing one’s neck like a hook and covering oneself with sackcloth and ashes,” as Isaiah says (58:5). Indeed, when a man abstains from bread, water, or any food whatsoever, and covers himself with sackcloth and ashes and afflicts himself, he is beloved, beautiful, and pleasing. But what is most pleasing is that he humble himself, that he “loose the bonds” of impiety and “undo the thongs” of deceit. Then “his light shall break forth like the dawn, and his righteousness shall go before him. He shall be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters do not fail” (Is 58:6-7).<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Romans <font dir="ltr">1:1-7.</font>@@@@@Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an Apostle, set apart for the Gospel of God, to all God’s beloved in Rome.<br /><br />
This Gospel, which God promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures,<br /><br />
concerns his Son, who according to the flesh was born of the lineage of David<br /><br />
and, according to the Spirit of holiness, was established in his power as Son of God by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.<br /><br />
Through him we have received grace and apostleship for the sake of his name, to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles,<br /><br />
including yourselves who are called by Jesus Christ.<br /><br />
To you who are called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br />

for he has done marvelous deeds;<br /><br />
his holy arm and his mighty hand<br /><br />
have gained him the victory.
The Lord has made known his victory;<br /><br />
he has revealed his righteousness to the nations;<br /><br />
he has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness<br /><br />
to the house of Israel.
All the ends of the earth have seen<br /><br />
the victory of our God.<br /><br />
Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth;<br /><br />
break forth into song, rejoice, and sing praises!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">11:29-32.</font>@@@@@At that time, as the crowds gathered, Jesus began to say: “This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.<br /><br />
For just as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.<br /><br />
At the Judgment, the Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation and condemn them. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.<br /><br />
At the Judgment, the men of Nineveh will rise up with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.”<br />
