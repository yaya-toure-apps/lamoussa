<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Then people will come from the east and the west and from the north and the south and will recline at table in the kingdom of God"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Father, your Son bequeathed to your Church<br /><br />
this memorial of his love;<br /><br />
as we call to mind his death and resurrection<br /><br />
we offer you the gift that you yourself have made,<br /><br />
the sacrifice that restores us to your grace.<br /><br />
Receive us also, together with your well-beloved Son;<br /><br />
give us in this meal your Holy Spirit:<br /><br />
may he disperse the cause of all that divides us<br /><br />
and confirm us in an even greater love,<br /><br />
in union with Pope Benedict XVI,<br /><br />
our Bishop N., the whole college of bishops<br /><br />
and all your people. <br /><br />
May your Church become in this world<br /><br />
a visible sign of unity and servant of your peace.<br /><br />
And as you gather us together here<br /><br />
at the table of your Son,<br /><br />
in union with the Virgin Mary, the holy Mother of God,<br /><br />
and with all the saints of heaven,<br /><br />
grant that one day the people of all countries and languages,<br /><br />
of every race and culture,<br /><br />
may be gathered at the banquet in your heavenly kingdom.<br /><br />
Then we will rejoice<br /><br />
in a unity at last accomplished,<br /><br />
a peace now finally complete<br /><br />
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.<br /><br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">8,26-30.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: The Spirit comes to the aid of our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes with inexpressible groanings.<br /><br />
And the one who searches hearts knows what is the intention of the Spirit, because it intercedes for the holy ones according to God&#039;s will.<br /><br />
We know that all things work for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.<br /><br />
For those he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.<br /><br />
And those he predestined he also called; and those he called he also justified; and those he justified he also glorified.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">13(12),4-5.6.</font>@@@@@Look, answer me, O LORD, my God!<br /><br />
Give light to my eyes that I may not sleep in death<br /><br />
lest my enemy say, “I have overcome him”;<br /><br />
lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.
Though I trusted in your mercy,<br /><br />
Let my heart rejoice in your salvation;<br /><br />
let me sing of the LORD, “He has been good to me.”<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">13,22-30.</font>@@@@@Jesus passed through towns and villages, teaching as he went and making his way to Jerusalem.<br /><br />
Someone asked him, &quot;Lord, will only a few people be saved?&quot; He answered them,<br /><br />
Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I tell you, will attempt to enter but will not be strong enough.<br /><br />
After the master of the house has arisen and locked the door, then will you stand outside knocking and saying, &#039;Lord, open the door for us.&#039; He will say to you in reply, &#039;I do not know where you are from.&#039;<br /><br />
And you will say, &#039;We ate and drank in your company and you taught in our streets.&#039;<br /><br />
Then he will say to you, &#039;I do not know where (you) are from. Depart from me, all you evildoers!&#039;<br /><br />
And there will be wailing and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves cast out.<br /><br />
And people will come from the east and the west and from the north and the south and will recline at table in the kingdom of God.<br /><br />
For behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.&quot;<br />
