 God, the Word, stirs up the lazy and arouses the sleeper. For indeed, someone who comes knocking at the door is always wanting to come in. But it depends on us if he does not always enter or always remain. May your door be open to him who comes; open your soul, enlarge your spiritual capacities, that you may discover the riches of simplicity, the treasures of peace and sweetness of grace. Expand your heart; run to meet the sun of that eternal light that “enlightens everyone” (Jn 1,9). It is certain that this true light shines for all, but if anyone shuts their windows then they themselves shut themselves off from this eternal light.
      So even Christ remains outside if you shut the door of your soul. It is true that he could enter but he doesn&#039;t want to use force, he doesn&#039;t put those who refuse under pressure. Descended from the Virgin, born from her womb, he shines throughout the universe to give light to all. Those who long to receive the light that shines with an everlasting brightness open up to him. No night comes to intervene. Indeed, the sun we see each day gives way to night&#039;s darkness; but the Sun of justice (Mal 3,20) knows no setting for Wisdom is not overcome by evil.

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">5,12.15b.17-19.20b-21.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: Through one man sin entered the world, and through sin, death, and thus death came to all men, inasmuch as all sinned—<br /><br />
But the gift is not like the transgression. For if by that one person&#039;s transgression the many died, how much more did the grace of God and the gracious gift of the one person Jesus Christ overflow for the many.<br /><br />
For if, by the transgression of one person, death came to reign through that one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of justification come to reign in life through the one person Jesus Christ.<br /><br />
In conclusion, just as through one transgression condemnation came upon all, so through one righteous act acquittal and life came to all.<br /><br />
For just as through the disobedience of one person the many were made sinners, so through the obedience of one the many will be made righteous.<br /><br />
The law entered in so that transgression might increase but, where sin increased, grace overflowed all the more,<br /><br />
so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through justification for eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">40(39),7-8a.8b-9.10.17.</font>@@@@@Sacrifice or oblation you wished not, <br /><br />
but ears open to obedience you gave me. <br /><br />
Burnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;<br /><br />
then said I, “Behold I come.”
“In the written scroll it is prescribed for me,<br /><br />
To do your will, O my God, is my delight, <br /><br />
and your law is within my heart!”
I announced your justice in the vast assembly; <br /><br />
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.
May all who seek you <br /><br />
exult and be glad in you, <br /><br />
and may those who love your salvation <br /><br />
say ever, “The LORD be glorified.”<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">12,35-38.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his disciples: “Gird your loins and light your lamps<br /><br />
and be like servants who await their master&#039;s return from a wedding, ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.<br /><br />
Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant on his arrival. Amen, I say to you, he will gird himself, have them recline at table, and proceed to wait on them.<br /><br />
And should he come in the second or third watch and find them prepared in this way, blessed are those servants.&quot;<br />
