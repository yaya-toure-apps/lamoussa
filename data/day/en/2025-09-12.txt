<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Blind and sick, yet I judge!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Oh, Fire of Love! Thanks, thanks be to You, Eternal Father! I am imperfect and full of darkness, and You, Perfection and Light, have shown to me perfection, and the resplendent way of the doctrine of Your only-begotten Son. <br /><br /><br />
I was dead, and You have brought me to life. I was sick, and You have given me medicine, and not only the medicine of the Blood which You gave for the diseased human race in the person of Your Son, but also a medicine against a secret infirmity that I knew not of, in this precept that, in no way, can I judge any rational creature, and particularly Your servants, upon whom oftentimes I, as one blind and sick with this infirmity, passed judgment under the pretext of Your honor and the salvation of souls. <br /><br /><br />
Wherefore, I thank You, Supreme and Eternal Good, that, in the manifesting of Your truth and the deceitfulness of the Devil, and our own passions, You have made me know my infirmity. Wherefore I beseech You, through grace and mercy, that, from today henceforward, I may never again wander from the path of Your doctrine, given by Your goodness to me and to whoever wishes to follow it, because without You is nothing done. To You, then, Eternal Father, do I have recourse and flee, and I do not beseech You for myself alone, Father, but for the whole world, and particularly for the mystical body of the holy Church.<br />

First Letter to Timothy <font dir="ltr">1,1-2.12-14.</font>@@@@@Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,<br /><br />
to Timothy, my true child in faith: grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.<br /><br />
I am grateful to him who has strengthened me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he considered me trustworthy in appointing me to the ministry.<br /><br />
I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and an arrogant man, but I have been mercifully treated because I acted out of ignorance in my unbelief.<br /><br />
Indeed, the grace of our Lord has been abundant, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">16(15),1-2a.5.7-8.11.</font>@@@@@Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;<br /><br />
I say to the LORD, &quot;My Lord are you.&quot;<br /><br />
O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup, <br /><br />
you it is who hold fast my lot.
I bless the LORD who counsels me; <br /><br />
even in the night my heart exhorts me.<br /><br />
I set the LORD ever before me; <br /><br />
with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.
You will show me the path to life, <br /><br />
fullness of joys in your presence, <br /><br />
the delights at your right hand forever.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">6,39-42.</font>@@@@@Jesus told his disciples a parable : &quot;Can a blind person guide a blind person? Will not both fall into a pit?<br /><br />
No disciple is superior to the teacher; but when fully trained, every disciple will be like his teacher.<br /><br />
Why do you notice the splinter in your brother&#039;s eye, but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own?<br /><br />
How can you say to your brother, &#039;Brother, let me remove that splinter in your eye,&#039; when you do not even notice the wooden beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! Remove the wooden beam from your eye first; then you will see clearly to remove the splinter in your brother&#039;s eye.&quot;<br />
