Book of Judges <font dir="ltr">11,29-39a.</font>@@@@@The spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah. He passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and through Mizpah-Gilead as well, and from there he went on to the Ammonites.<br /><br />
Jephthah made a vow to the LORD. &quot;If you deliver the Ammonites into my power,&quot; he said,<br /><br />
&quot;whoever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites shall belong to the LORD. I shall offer him up as a holocaust.&quot;<br /><br />
Jephthah then went on to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the LORD delivered them into his power,<br /><br />
so that he inflicted a severe defeat on them, from Aroer to the approach of Minnith (twenty cities in all) and as far as Abel-keramin. Thus were the Ammonites brought into subjection by the Israelites.<br /><br />
When Jephthah returned to his house in Mizpah, it was his daughter who came forth, playing the tambourines and dancing. She was an only child: he had neither son nor daughter besides her.<br /><br />
When he saw her, he rent his garments and said, &quot;Alas, daughter, you have struck me down and brought calamity upon me. For I have made a vow to the LORD and I cannot retract.&quot;<br /><br />
&quot;Father,&quot; she replied, &quot;you have made a vow to the LORD. Do with me as you have vowed, because the LORD has wrought vengeance for you on your enemies the Ammonites.&quot;<br /><br />
Then she said to her father, &quot;Let me have this favor. Spare me for two months, that I may go off down the mountains to mourn my virginity with my companions.&quot;<br /><br />
&quot;Go,&quot; he replied, and sent her away for two months. So she departed with her companions and mourned her virginity on the mountains.<br /><br />
At the end of the two months she returned to her father, who did to her as he had vowed.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">40(39),5.7-8a.8b-9.10.</font>@@@@@Blessed the man who makes the LORD his trust; <br /><br />
who turns not to idolatry <br /><br />
or to those who stray after falsehood.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Sacrifice or oblation you wished not, <br /><br />
but ears open to obedience you gave me. <br /><br />
Burnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;<br /><br />
then said I, “Behold I come.”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
“In the written scroll it is prescribed for me,<br /><br />
To do your will, O my God, is my delight, <br /><br />
and your law is within my heart!”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I announced your justice in the vast assembly; <br /><br />
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">22,1-14.</font>@@@@@Jesus again in reply spoke to the chief priests and the elders of the people in parables saying,<br /><br />
“The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.<br /><br />
He dispatched his servants to summon the invited guests to the feast, but they refused to come.<br /><br />
A second time he sent other servants, saying, &#039;Tell those invited: &quot;Behold, I have prepared my banquet, my calves and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready; come to the feast.&quot;&#039;<br /><br />
Some ignored the invitation and went away, one to his farm, another to his business.<br /><br />
The rest laid hold of his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.<br /><br />
The king was enraged and sent his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.<br /><br />
Then he said to his servants, &#039;The feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come.<br /><br />
Go out, therefore, into the main roads and invite to the feast whomever you find.&#039;<br /><br />
The servants went out into the streets and gathered all they found, bad and good alike, and the hall was filled with guests.<br /><br />
But when the king came in to meet the guests he saw a man there not dressed in a wedding garment.<br /><br />
He said to him, &#039;My friend, how is it that you came in here without a wedding garment?&#039; But he was reduced to silence.<br /><br />
Then the king said to his attendants, &#039;Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the darkness outside, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.&#039;<br /><br />
Many are invited, but few are chosen.&quot;<br />
