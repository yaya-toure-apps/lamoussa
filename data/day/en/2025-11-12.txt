<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Father, Glorify your name!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
S. John xii, 27. Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour. Father, glorify now thy Son. <br /><br /><br />
This is another form of the prayer of Gethsemane, a simple cry to God of our human nature, human nature in great suffering and great need, but which then pulls itself together and cries: ‘ My God, what matters this or any other thing I may suffer.’ All I care for is your glory. <br /><br /><br />
I ask only this and nothing else. Forget my first request. I made it to you as my Father, because in duty I should shew you my pressing need. But having shewn you my <br /><br />
need, in all simplicity I only say over and over again how infinitely greater is my need, my desire, for your glory and honour. This is my true and only desire, and I pray you with all my soul to satisfy this desire. My Father, glorify yourself in me. My Father, glorify your Holy Name. <br /><br /><br />
My Lord Jesus, let me, a miserable creature, join with you in making this prayer. My God, my voice unites with the adorable voice of my Lord Jesus in saying ‘Not my will but thine be done.’ My only desire is for your glory; this is what 1 thirst for. My Father, do with me as you please, whatever it may be. My Father, may your name be glorified. <br />

Book of Wisdom <font dir="ltr">6,2-11.</font>@@@@@Hear, O kings, and understand; learn, you magistrates of the earth’s expanse! Hearken, you who are in power over the multitude and lord it over throngs of peoples!<br /><br />
Because authority was given you by the LORD and sovereignty by the Most High, who shall probe your works and scrutinize your counsels!<br /><br />
Because, though you were ministers of his kingdom, you judged not rightly, and did not keep the law, nor walk according to the will of God,<br /><br />
Terribly and swiftly shall he come against you, because judgment is stern for the exalted-<br /><br />
For the lowly may be pardoned out of mercy but the mighty shall be mightily put to the test.<br /><br />
For the Lord of all shows no partiality, nor does he fear greatness, Because he himself made the great as well as the small, and he provides for all alike;<br /><br />
but for those in power a rigorous scrutiny impends.<br /><br />
To you, therefore, O princes, are my words addressed that you may learn wisdom and that you may not sin.<br /><br />
For those who keep the holy precepts hallowed shall be found holy, and those learned in them will have ready a response.<br /><br />
Desire therefore my words; long for them and you shall be instructed.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">82(81),3-4.6-7.</font>@@@@@Defend the lowly and the fatherless;<br /><br />
render justice to the afflicted and the destitute.<br /><br />
Rescue the lowly and the poor;<br /><br />
from the hand of the wicked deliver them.
I said: “You are gods,<br /><br />
all of you sons of the Most High;<br /><br />
yet like men you shall die,<br /><br />
and fall like any prince.”<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">17,11-19.</font>@@@@@As Jesus continued his journey to Jerusalem, he traveled through Samaria and Galilee.<br /><br />
As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him. They stood at a distance from him<br /><br />
and raised their voice, saying, &quot;Jesus, Master! Have pity on us!&quot;<br /><br />
And when he saw them, he said, &quot;Go show yourselves to the priests.&quot; As they were going they were cleansed.<br /><br />
And one of them, realizing he had been healed, returned, glorifying God in a loud voice;<br /><br />
and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan.<br /><br />
Jesus said in reply, &quot;Ten were cleansed, were they not? Where are the other nine?<br /><br />
Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?&quot;<br /><br />
Then he said to him, &quot;Stand up and go; your faith has saved you.&quot;<br />
