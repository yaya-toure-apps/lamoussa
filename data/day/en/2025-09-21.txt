<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Grant me to be worthy of praising you</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Thanks to your creative nature<br /><br />
A house was built for rational being;<br /><br />
The first man was established as steward<br /><br />
Of this earthly house here below.<br /><br /><br />
And his descendants, who came into being<br /><br />
Receive from You various stewardships:<br /><br />
Some for the most glorious bodily works,<br /><br />
And others to distribute spiritual goods. (â€¦)<br /><br /><br />
You have also placed as faithful steward<br /><br />
Of body and soul, the incorporeal Spirit<br /><br />
To give to each what he needs<br /><br />
With care, according to his rank:<br /><br /><br />
Nourishing the soul with the Word<br /><br />
And caring for the body with moderation;<br /><br />
And between the two, acting as arbiter<br /><br />
He maintains their rank in rectitude.<br /><br /><br />
The body must be ordered as a servant<br /><br />
Following your order of creation,<br /><br />
And the soul, like a sovereign princess,<br /><br />
Following the image of your Archetype.<br /><br /><br />
But I, unfaithful to both,<br /><br />
Toward my soul and that of others,<br /><br />
I have become like the unfaithful steward,<br /><br />
Who is the example of cowardice.<br /><br /><br />
For, at the end of my life here below<br /><br />
I can neither do good,<br /><br />
Nor beg from those who possess it,<br /><br />
For I am ashamed because they will not give me.<br /><br /><br />
But You, liberal in all things,<br /><br />
Give remorse to my impenitent soul,<br /><br />
To return to You completely,<br /><br />
Before I am called to the Judgment Court,<br /><br /><br />
For the judgment of my sins;<br /><br />
To forgive me at least part of the debt:<br /><br />
To my soul, the fifty measures of oil,<br /><br />
To my body, the twenty measures of wheat.<br /><br /><br />
Grant me, too, the grace, like the steward<br /><br />
To be worthy of Your praise; Although I am a child of the world,<br /><br />
Give me the wisdom to convert from sin!<br />

Book of Amos <font dir="ltr">8,4-7.</font>@@@@@Hear this, you who trample upon the needy and destroy the poor of the land!<br /><br />
&quot;When will the new moon be over,&quot; you ask, &quot;that we may sell our grain, and the sabbath, that we may display the wheat? We will diminish the ephah, add to the shekel, and fix our scales for cheating!<br /><br />
We will buy the lowly man for silver, and the poor man for a pair of sandals; even the refuse of the wheat we will sell!&quot;<br /><br />
The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob: Never will I forget a thing they have done!<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">113(112),1-2.4-6.7-8.</font>@@@@@Praise, you servants of the LORD, <br /><br />
praise the name of the LORD.<br /><br />
Blessed be the name of the LORD <br /><br />
both now and forever.
High above all nations is the LORD; <br /><br />
above the heavens is his glory.<br /><br />
Who is like the LORD, our God, who is enthroned on high<br /><br />
who looks upon the heavens and the earth below?
He raises up the lowly from the dust; <br /><br />
from the dunghill he lifts up the poor.<br /><br />
To seat them with princes, <br /><br />
with the princes of his own people.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">16,1-13.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his disciples, &quot;A rich man had a steward who was reported to him for squandering his property.<br /><br />
He summoned him and said, &#039;What is this I hear about you? Prepare a full account of your stewardship, because you can no longer be my steward.&#039;<br /><br />
The steward said to himself, &#039;What shall I do, now that my master is taking the position of steward away from me? I am not strong enough to dig and I am ashamed to beg.<br /><br />
I know what I shall do so that, when I am removed from the stewardship, they may welcome me into their homes.&#039;<br /><br />
He called in his master&#039;s debtors one by one. To the first he said, &#039;How much do you owe my master?&#039;<br /><br />
He replied, &#039;One hundred measures of olive oil.&#039; He said to him, &#039;Here is your promissory note. Sit down and quickly write one for fifty.&#039;<br /><br />
Then to another he said, &#039;And you, how much do you owe?&#039; He replied, &#039;One hundred kors of wheat.&#039; He said to him, &#039;Here is your promissory note; write one for eighty.&#039;<br /><br />
And the master commended that dishonest steward for acting prudently. &quot;For the children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.&quot;<br /><br />
I tell you, make friends for yourselves with dishonest wealth, so that when it fails, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.<br /><br />
The person who is trustworthy in very small matters is also trustworthy in great ones; and the person who is dishonest in very small matters is also dishonest in great ones.<br /><br />
If, therefore, you are not trustworthy with dishonest wealth, who will trust you with true wealth?<br /><br />
If you are not trustworthy with what belongs to another, who will give you what is yours?<br /><br />
No servant can serve two masters. He will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.&quot;<br />

First Letter to Timothy <font dir="ltr">2,1-8.</font>@@@@@Beloved : First of all, I ask that supplications, prayers, petitions, and thanksgivings be offered for everyone,<br /><br />
for kings and for all in authority, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all devotion and dignity.<br /><br />
This is good and pleasing to God our savior,<br /><br />
who wills everyone to be saved and to come to knowledge of the truth.<br /><br />
For there is one God. There is also one mediator between God and the human race, Christ Jesus, himself human,<br /><br />
who gave himself as ransom for all. This was the testimony at the proper time.<br /><br />
For this I was appointed preacher and apostle (I am speaking the truth, I am not lying), teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.<br /><br />
It is my wish, then, that in every place the men should pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or argument.<br />
