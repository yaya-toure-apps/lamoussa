<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Accompanying him were the Twelve and some women "</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
&quot;If you knew the gift of God&quot; (Jn 4:10), Jesus says to the Samaritan woman during one of those remarkable conversations which show his great esteem for the dignity of women and for the vocation which enables them to share in his messianic mission… The Church desires to give thanks to the Most Holy Trinity for the &quot;mystery of woman&quot; and for every woman - for that which constitutes the eternal measure of her feminine dignity, for the &quot;great works of God&quot;, which throughout human history have been accomplished in and through her. After all, was it not in and through her that the greatest event in human history - the incarnation of God himself - was accomplished?<br /><br /><br />
Therefore the Church gives thanks for each and every woman: for mothers, for sisters, for wives; for women consecrated to God in virginity; for women dedicated to the many human beings who await the gratuitous love of another person; for women who watch over the human persons in the family, which is the fundamental sign of the human community; for women who work professionally, and who at times are burdened by a great social responsibility…<br /><br /><br />
The Church gives thanks for all the manifestations of the feminine &quot;genius&quot; which have appeared in the course of history, in the midst of all peoples and nations; she gives thanks for all the charisms which the Holy Spirit distributes to women in the history of the People of God… The Church asks at the same time that these invaluable &quot;manifestations of the Spirit&quot; (cf. 1 Cor 12:4 ff)… may be attentively recognized and appreciated so that they may return for the common good of the Church and of humanity.<br /><br />

First Letter to Timothy <font dir="ltr">6,2c-12.</font>@@@@@Beloved: Teach and urge these things.<br /><br />
Whoever teaches something different and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the religious teaching<br /><br />
is conceited, understanding nothing, and has a morbid disposition for arguments and verbal disputes. From these come envy, rivalry, insults, evil suspicions,<br /><br />
and mutual friction among people with corrupted minds, who are deprived of the truth, supposing religion to be a means of gain.<br /><br />
Indeed, religion with contentment is a great gain.<br /><br />
For we brought nothing into the world, just as we shall not be able to take anything out of it.<br /><br />
If we have food and clothing, we shall be content with that.<br /><br />
Those who want to be rich are falling into temptation and into a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge them into ruin and destruction.<br /><br />
For the love of money is the root of all evils, and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains.<br /><br />
But you, man of God, avoid all this. Instead, pursue righteousness, devotion, faith, love, patience, and gentleness.<br /><br />
Compete well for the faith. Lay hold of eternal life, to which you were called when you made the noble confession in the presence of many witnesses.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">49(48),6-7.8-10.17-18.19-20.</font>@@@@@Why should I fear in evil days <br /><br />
when my wicked ensnarers ring me round?<br /><br />
They trust in their wealth; <br /><br />
the abundance of their riches is their boast.
Yet in no way can a man redeem himself, <br /><br />
or pay his own ransom to God;<br /><br />
Too high is the price to redeem one’s life; he would never have enough<br /><br />
to remain alive always and not see destruction.
Fear not when a man grows rich, <br /><br />
when the wealth of his house becomes great,<br /><br />
For when he dies, he shall take none of it; <br /><br />
his wealth shall not follow him down.
Though in his lifetime he counted himself blessed, <br /><br />
“They will praise you for doing well for yourself,”<br /><br />
He shall join the circle of his forebears <br /><br />
who shall never more see light.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">8,1-3.</font>@@@@@Jesus journeyed from one town and village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom of God. Accompanying him were the Twelve<br /><br />
and some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,<br /><br />
Joanna, the wife of Herod&#039;s steward Chuza, Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their resources.<br />
