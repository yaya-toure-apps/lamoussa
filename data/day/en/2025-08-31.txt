<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">God so totally humbled Himself, that no one can go lower!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
The Incarnation sprang from the goodness of  God. The humility contained in this mystery is  amazing, marvellous, astonishing. It shines with a  dazzling brilliance. God, the Essence, the Infinite,  Perfection, Creator, All-Powerful, the Great Sovereign Lord of All, becomes a man and takes on himself the body and soul of a man. He appears on earth as a man, and the humblest of men. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
What is man’s respect worth? Was it meant that God should seek to possess it? As he looks down upon the world from the height of his divinity all seem equal in his eyes, the great, the small, all like ants and worms to him. He disdained all false grandeur, which is in reality so very small, and had no wish to assume it himself. And as he came on earth to ransom us and teach us, he taught us from the very first, and all through his life, to despise human greatness and detach ourselves entirely from man’s esteem. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
He was born, lived and died in deepest abjection, in the lowest humiliation, for he took once for all the lowest place so completely that no one has ever humbled himself lower than he did. It was to teach us that he put himself last so constantly, and to shew us that men and their respect are worth nothing; He teaches us that since our conversation is not of this world we should make no matter of the forms of this world, but live only for that heavenly Kingdom which the God-man saw for ever here below by the Beatific Vision, and which we should see always with the eyes of Faith, walking in this world as though we were not of this world, without concern of outside things and busy with one thing only, with contemplating and loving our Heavenly Father and doing his Will. <br />

Book of Sirach <font dir="ltr">3,17-18.20.28-29.</font>@@@@@My child, conduct your affairs with humility, and you will be loved more than a giver of gifts.<br /><br />
Humble yourself the more, the greater you are, and you will find favor with God.<br /><br />
What is too sublime for you, seek not, into things beyond your strength search not.<br /><br />
The mind of a sage appreciates proverbs, and an attentive ear is the wise man&#039;s joy.<br /><br />
Water quenches a flaming fire, and alms atone for sins.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">68(67),4-5.6-7.10-11.</font>@@@@@The just rejoice and exult before God; <br /><br />
they are glad and rejoice.<br /><br />
Sing to God, chant praise to his name; <br /><br />
whose name is the LORD.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The father of orphans and the defender of widows <br /><br />
is God in his holy dwelling.<br /><br />
God gives a home to the forsaken; <br /><br />
he leads forth prisoners to prosperity.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A bountiful rain you showered down, O God, upon your inheritance; <br /><br />
you restored the land when it languished;<br /><br />
your flock settled in it; <br /><br />
in your goodness, O God, you provided it for the needy.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">14,1.7-14.</font>@@@@@On a sabbath Jesus went to dine at the home of one of the leading Pharisees, and the people there were observing him carefully.<br /><br />
He told a parable to those who had been invited, noticing how they were choosing the places of honor at the table.<br /><br />
When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do not recline at table in the place of honor. A more distinguished guest than you may have been invited by him,<br /><br />
and the host who invited both of you may approach you and say, &#039;Give your place to this man,&#039; and then you would proceed with embarrassment to take the lowest place.<br /><br />
Rather, when you are invited, go and take the lowest place so that when the host comes to you he may say, &#039;My friend, move up to a higher position.&#039; Then you will enjoy the esteem of your companions at the table.<br /><br />
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;<br /><br />
Then he said to the host who invited him, &quot;When you hold a lunch or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors, in case they may invite you back and you have repayment.<br /><br />
Rather, when you hold a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;<br /><br />
blessed indeed will you be because of their inability to repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.&quot;<br />

Letter to the Hebrews <font dir="ltr">12,18-19.22-24.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: You have not approached that which could be touched and a blazing fire and gloomy darkness and storm<br /><br />
and a trumpet blast and a voice speaking words such that those who heard begged that no message be further addressed to them,<br /><br />
No, you have approached Mount Zion and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and countless angels in festal gathering,<br /><br />
and the assembly of the firstborn enrolled in heaven, and God the judge of all, and the spirits of the just made perfect,<br /><br />
and Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and the sprinkled blood that speaks more eloquently than that of Abel.<br />
