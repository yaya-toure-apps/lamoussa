<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Christ will demand an account from me...</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            Behold, my sins cause me deep fear, my omissions cover me with profound shame, the squandering of my life causes me great dread. I fear that future examination where Christ, the noble man, will demand an account from me. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
            If he wished to demand from me the time he entrusted to me, and the intelligence, that talent he gave me to yield interest, without any doubt I would have no fitting answer to give to your charity. What shall I do? To which side shall I turn? I cannot dig the earth; to beg, I am ashamed (Lk 16:3). O Tenderness! Tenderness! open your mouth now; let your sweet counsel, I beg you, comfort my soul. Please, answer me: what will you decide to do with me in this circumstance, for according to your name you are truly a tender heart, and you know perfectly well what in this circumstance is fitting for me. Please forgive me and come to my aid and, in this trial, do not look upon me with indifference. Be moved by the poverty of my spirit and, with a heart touched with compassion, say to me in your kindness: “Let us share a common purse.” (Pr 1:14)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            O Tenderness! Tenderness! do you not have stored within you such great and beautiful riches that heaven and earth cannot contain them? You have constrained my Jesus to give his soul for my soul, his life for mine; thus you have made mine all that is his, and so, through your abundance, you have increased the resources of the poor. Please summon my famished soul to your liberality, so that I may live fully from your riches and that, raised by you, nourished by you, I may not fail in the service of the Lord, until, under your guidance, I return to my God, and give back my spirit to him who gave it to me (Eccl 12:7).<br />

First Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians <font dir="ltr">4:9-11.</font>@@@@@Brothers, concerning fraternal love, you have no need that I write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another,<br /><br />
and indeed you do so toward all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Brothers, we encourage you to progress even more:<br /><br />
make it your ambition to live quietly, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we commanded you.<br />

for he has done wonders; <br /><br />
by his holy arm, by his mighty hand, <br /><br />
he has won the victory.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Let the sea resound and all within it, <br /><br />
the world and all its inhabitants; <br /><br />
let the rivers clap their hands, <br /><br />
let the mountains sing for joy.<br /><br />

Acclaim the Lord, for he comes <br /><br />
to govern the earth, <br /><br />
to govern the world with justice <br /><br />
and the peoples with uprightness!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">25:14-30.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus told his disciples this parable: “A man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.<br /><br />
To one he gave a sum of five talents, to another two talents, to a third one talent, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. Immediately,<br /><br />
the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them and gained five more.<br /><br />
Likewise, the one who had received two talents gained two more.<br /><br />
But the one who had received only one went and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money.<br /><br />
After a long time, the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.<br /><br />
The one who had received five talents came forward, bringing five more, saying: “Lord, you entrusted me with five talents; see, I have gained five more.”<br /><br />
His master said to him: “Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your lord.”<br /><br />
The one who had received two talents also came and said: “Lord, you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.”<br /><br />
His master said to him: “Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your lord.”<br /><br />
The one who had received only one talent also came and said: “Lord, I knew you to be a hard man: reaping where you did not sow, gathering where you did not scatter seed.<br /><br />
So I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.”<br /><br />
But his master answered him: “Wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter.<br /><br />
Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received what was mine with interest.<br /><br />
So take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten.<br /><br />
For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.<br /><br />
And cast this worthless servant into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!”<br />
