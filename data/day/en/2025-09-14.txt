<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Proclaim with joy that Christ was crucified for us!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Not only do we not have to be ashamed of the death of our Lord God, but we should draw from it the greatest confidence and pride. By accepting from us the death he found in us, he most faithfully promised to give us in him the life we could not have on our own. And if he who is without sin loved us so much that he suffered for us sinners what we deserved by our sin, how will he not, who justifies us, give us what is righteousness? How will he not, who is faithful to his promises and who bore the penalty for the guilty, give the righteous their reward?<br /><br /><br />
Let us acknowledge without trembling, my brothers, and proclaim that Christ was crucified for us. Let us say this without fear and with joy, without shame and with pride. The Apostle Paul saw this, he who made it a title of glory. After recalling the many great graces he received from Christ, he does not say that he glories in these marvels, but he says: &quot;As for me, God forbid that I should boast anywhere but in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (Gal 6:14).<br />

Book of Numbers <font dir="ltr">21,4b-9.</font>@@@@@With their patience worn out by the journey,<br /><br />
the people complained against God and Moses, &quot;Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in this desert, where there is no food or water? We are disgusted with this wretched food!&quot;<br /><br />
In punishment the LORD sent among the people saraph serpents, which bit the people so that many of them died.<br /><br />
Then the people came to Moses and said, &quot;We have sinned in complaining against the LORD and you. Pray the LORD to take the serpents from us.&quot; So Moses prayed for the people,<br /><br />
and the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Make a saraph and mount it on a pole, and if anyone who has been bitten looks at it, he will recover.&quot;<br /><br />
Moses accordingly made a bronze serpent and mounted it on a pole, and whenever anyone who had been bitten by a serpent looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">78(77),1-2.34-35.36-37.38.</font>@@@@@Hearken, my people, to my teaching; <br /><br />
incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br /><br />
I will open my mouth in a parable, <br /><br />
I will utter mysteries from of old.
While he slew them they sought him <br /><br />
and inquired after God again,<br /><br />
Remembering that God was their rock <br /><br />
and the Most High God, their redeemer.
But they flattered him with their mouths <br /><br />
and lied to him with their tongues,<br /><br />
Though their hearts were not steadfast toward him, <br /><br />
nor were they faithful to his covenant.
But he, being merciful, forgave their sin <br /><br />
and destroyed them not; <br /><br />
often he turned back his anger <br /><br />
and let none of his wrath be roused.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John <font dir="ltr">3,13-17.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to Nicodemus : &quot;No one has gone up to heaven except the one who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man.<br /><br />
And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,<br /><br />
so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.&quot;<br /><br />
For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life.<br /><br />
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.<br />
