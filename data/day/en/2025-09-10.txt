<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">« Blessed are you who are poor »</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            Since almost all men are naturally inclined to pride, the Lord begins the Beatitudes by setting aside the original evil of self-sufficiency and advising the imitation of the true voluntary Poor One who is truly blessed — so as to resemble him through voluntary poverty, according to our ability, in order to share in his blessedness, in his happiness. «&amp;nbsp;Have in you the same mind that was in Christ Jesus. Though he was in the form of God, he did not regard equality with God as something to be grasped, but he emptied himself, taking the form of a slave&amp;nbsp;» (Ph 2:5-7).<br /><br />
<br />
            What is more miserable for God than to take the form of a slave&amp;nbsp;? What is more lowly for the King of the universe than to share our human nature&amp;nbsp;? The King of kings and the Lord of lords, the Judge of the universe, pays taxes to Caesar (1Tm 6:17; Heb 12:23; Mk 12:17). The Master of creation embraces this world, enters a cave, finds no room in an inn, and takes refuge in a stable in the company of senseless animals. He who is pure and spotless takes upon himself the defilements of human nature, and after sharing all our misery, he even goes so far as to experience death. Consider the excess of his voluntary poverty&amp;nbsp;! Life tastes death, the Judge is dragged before the tribunal, the Master of the life of all submits to a magistrate, the King of the heavenly powers does not escape the hands of the executioners. By this example, says the apostle Paul, is measured his humility (Ph 2:5-7).<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">3:1-11.</font>@@@@@Brothers, if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.<br /><br />
Set your minds on the things that are above, not on the things that are on earth.<br /><br />
For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.<br /><br />
When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.<br /><br />
Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry.<br /><br />
On account of these the wrath of God is coming upon those who disobey him,<br /><br />
and these are the ways you once followed, when you were living that life.<br /><br />
But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and foul talk from your mouth.<br /><br />
Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices<br /><br />
and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator.<br /><br />
In that renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">145(144):2-3.10-11.12-13ab.</font>@@@@@Every day I will bless you, <br /><br />
I will praise your name forever and ever.<br /><br />
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; <br /><br />
his greatness is unsearchable.
All your works shall give thanks to you, O Lord, <br /><br />
and all your faithful shall bless you!<br /><br />
They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom, <br /><br />
and tell of your power.
They shall make known to men your mighty deeds, <br /><br />
and the glorious splendor of your kingdom:<br /><br />
Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,<br /><br />
your dominion endures through all generations.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">6:20-26.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus, looking up at his disciples, said: « Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.<br /><br />
Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.<br /><br />
Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man.<br /><br />
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.<br /><br />
But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation!<br /><br />
Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry! Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep!<br /><br />
Woe to you when all speak well of you! For that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets. »<br />
