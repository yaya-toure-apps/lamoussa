<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“When you give a banquet, invite the poor.”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      Let us care for the health of our neighbor with as much diligence as for our own, whether he be strong or worn out by illness. For “we are all one in the Lord” (Rom 12:5), rich or poor, slave or free, healthy or sick. For all there is but one Head, the source of all — Christ (Col 1:18); what the members of the body are to one another, each of us is to each of our brethren. Therefore, we must neither neglect nor abandon those who have fallen before us into a state of weakness that threatens us all. Rather than rejoicing in being well, it is better to have compassion for the misfortunes of our poor brethren... They are made in the image of God as we are, and despite their apparent degradation, they have preserved more faithfully than we the likeness of that image. In them, the inner man has put on the same Christ and they have received the same “pledge of the Spirit” (2 Cor 5:5); they share the same laws, the same commandments, the same covenants, the same assemblies, the same mysteries, the same hope. Christ died for them also, “He who takes away the sin of the world” (Jn 1:29). They have a share in the inheritance of heavenly life, they who have been deprived of many goods here below. They are companions in the sufferings of Christ, and they shall be companions in His glory.<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Romans <font dir="ltr">11:29-36.</font>@@@@@The gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.<br /><br />
Just as you once disobeyed God, but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,<br /><br />
so they have now disobeyed in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they also may now receive mercy.<br /><br />
For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that He may have mercy upon all.<br /><br />
Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how inscrutable His ways!<br /><br />
“For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?<br /><br />
Or who has given Him a gift in advance so as to be repaid?”<br /><br />
For from Him and through Him and for Him are all things. To Him be glory forever! Amen.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">69(68):30-31,33-34,36,37b.</font>@@@@@But I am afflicted and in pain;<br /><br />
let Your salvation, O God, set me on high.<br /><br />
I will praise the name of God with a song;<br /><br />
I will magnify Him with thanksgiving.<br /><br />
The poor have seen and are glad:<br /><br />
“Seekers of God, may your hearts revive!”<br /><br />
For the Lord listens to the needy;<br /><br />
He does not forget His people in prison.<br /><br />
For God will save Zion<br /><br />
and rebuild the cities of Judah.<br /><br />
He shall make it a dwelling and an inheritance:<br /><br />
a possession for the descendants of His servants,<br /><br />
a home for those who love His name.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">14:12-14.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus also said to the one who had invited Him: “When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors; otherwise, they too may invite you in return and you would be repaid.<br /><br />
Instead, when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind;<br /><br />
blessed will you be, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.”<br />
