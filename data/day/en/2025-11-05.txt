Now that our Head has ascended, it is fitting that the members (Col 2,19)... take the path which he has trodden so truly before us. For “it was needful for Christ to suffer thus, and so to enter into his glory” (Lk 24,26). We must follow this dear Champion who has borne the standard before us. Let everyone take up their cross and follow him and we shall come to the place where he is. You know how people will often follow the world in pursuit of empty honors; how they will despise their bodies, their comfort, their home, and friends, and go out to war, only to win treasure for themselves! We, too, must likewise renounce everything for the sake of the pure treasure which is God, and follow our blessed Lord, who is our Head... 
There are plenty of persons who would gladly be Christ&#039;s witnesses in peace, when everything goes along just as they would wish. They would like to be holy, provided that their pious exercises and work never become irksome; they would be glad enough to enjoy, desire, or know the things of God, if there were no bitterness, labor, or tedium involved. But once they are assailed by strong temptations and spiritual darkness, as soon as they no longer feel or enjoy the nearness of God, and are left destitute inwardly and outwardly, they fall away and are not true witnesses at all... Oh, if we could only shake ourselves free from this tendency, and learn to seek peace in tribulation. Only there is true peace born, peace which will last and really endure.<br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">13,8-10.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: Owe nothing to anyone, except to love one another; for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.<br /><br />
The commandments, &quot;You shall not commit adultery; you shall not kill; you shall not steal; you shall not covet,&quot; and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this saying, (namely) &quot;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&quot;<br /><br />
Love does no evil to the neighbor; hence, love is the fulfillment of the law.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">112(111),1-2.4-5.9.</font>@@@@@Blessed the man who fears the LORD, <br /><br />
who greatly delights in his commands.<br /><br />
His posterity shall be mighty upon the earth; <br /><br />
the upright generation shall be blessed.
Light shines through the darkness for the upright; <br /><br />
he is gracious and merciful and just.<br /><br />
Well for the man who is gracious and lends, <br /><br />
who conducts his affairs with justice;
Lavishly he gives to the poor, <br /><br />
his justice shall endure forever; <br /><br />
his horn shall be exalted in glory.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">14,25-33.</font>@@@@@Great crowds were traveling with Jesus, and he turned and addressed them,<br /><br />
&quot;If any one comes to me without hating his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.<br /><br />
Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.<br /><br />
Which of you wishing to construct a tower does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if there is enough for its completion?<br /><br />
Otherwise, after laying the foundation and finding himself unable to finish the work the onlookers should laugh at him<br /><br />
and say, &#039;This one began to build but did not have the resources to finish.&#039;<br /><br />
Or what king marching into battle would not first sit down and decide whether with ten thousand troops he can successfully oppose another king advancing upon him with twenty thousand troops?<br /><br />
But if not, while he is still far away, he will send a delegation to ask for peace terms.<br /><br />
In the same way, anyone of you who does not renounce all his possessions cannot be my disciple.&quot;<br />
