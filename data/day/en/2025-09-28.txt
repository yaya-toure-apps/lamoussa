<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Humanity calls to You without ceasing, God of Mercy</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
May You be adored, O merciful God of ours, <br /><br />
O All-powerful Lord and Creator. <br /><br />
In deepest humility, we give You praise, <br /><br />
Plunging ourselves into the ocean of your Godhead. <br /><br /><br />
But man did not persevere in the hour of trial. <br /><br />
At the instigation of the evil one, he became unfaithful to You. <br /><br />
He lost Your grace and gifts; only misery was left him, <br /><br />
And tears, suffering, sorrow and bitterness, until he would rest in the grave. <br /><br /><br />
But you, O merciful God, did not let humanity perish, <br /><br />
And gave it the promise of a Redeemer. <br /><br />
You did not let us despair, despite our grave offenses, <br /><br />
And You sent Your prophets to Israel. <br /><br /><br />
Still, day and night, mankind cries out to You, <br /><br />
From the abyss of misery, sin and all pain. <br /><br />
Hear the moaning and the tears, You who reign in heaven, <br /><br />
God of great mercy, God of compassion. <br /><br /><br />
Man erred, but he cannot ask pardon, <br /><br />
Because a gaping chasm has appeared between God and man. <br /><br />
With the voice of his misery, he cries out, “Mercy!” <br /><br />
But Yahweh is silent.... And century after century passes on. <br /><br /><br />
But the longing of all humankind grows deeper. <br /><br />
A longing for Him who has been promised. <br /><br />
Come, Lamb of God, take away our vile sins, <br /><br />
Come, illumine our darkness like a ray of light. <br /><br /><br />
Humanity calls out to You unceasingly, O Lord of lords, <br /><br />
Calls out to Your unfathomable mercy, to Your compassion. <br /><br />
O great Yahweh, grant that we may make atonement, <br /><br />
Remember Your goodness, and forgive us our sins. <br /><br /><br />

Book of Amos <font dir="ltr">6,1.4-7.</font>@@@@@Thus says the LORD the God of hosts: Woe to the complacent in Zion!<br /><br />
Lying upon beds of ivory, stretched comfortably on their couches, They eat lambs taken from the flock, and calves from the stall!<br /><br />
Improvising to the music of the harp, like David, they devise their own accompaniment.<br /><br />
They drink wine from bowls and anoint themselves with the best oils; yet they are not made ill by the collapse of Joseph!<br /><br />
Therefore, now they shall be the first to go into exile, and their wanton revelry shall be done away with.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">146(145),7.8-9.10.</font>@@@@@The LORD keeps faith forever,<br /><br />
secures justice for the oppressed, <br /><br />
gives food to the hungry. <br /><br />
the LORD sets captives free.
The LORD gives sight to the blind. <br /><br />
The LORD raises up those who were bowed down; <br /><br />
the LORD loves the just.<br /><br />
The LORD protects strangers. <br /><br /><br />
The fatherless and the widow he sustains, <br /><br />
but the way of the wicked he thwarts.<br /><br />
The LORD shall reign forever; <br /><br />
your God, O Zion, through all generations. Alleluia.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">16,19-31.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to the Pharisees: &quot;There was a rich man who dressed in purple garments and fine linen and dined sumptuously each day.<br /><br />
And lying at his door was a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores,<br /><br />
who would gladly have eaten his fill of the scraps that fell from the rich man&#039;s table. Dogs even used to come and lick his sores.<br /><br />
When the poor man died, he was carried away by angels to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried,<br /><br />
and from the netherworld, where he was in torment, he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.<br /><br />
And he cried out, &#039;Father Abraham, have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering torment in these flames.&#039;<br /><br />
Abraham replied, &#039;My child, remember that you received what was good during your lifetime while Lazarus likewise received what was bad; but now he is comforted here, whereas you are tormented.<br /><br />
Moreover, between us and you a great chasm is established to prevent anyone from crossing who might wish to go from our side to yours or from your side to ours.&#039;<br /><br />
He said, &#039;Then I beg you, father, send him to my father&#039;s house,<br /><br />
for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they too come to this place of torment.&#039;<br /><br />
But Abraham replied, &#039;They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.&#039;<br /><br />
He said, &#039;Oh no, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.&#039;<br /><br />
Then Abraham said, &#039;If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead.&#039;&quot;<br />

First Letter to Timothy <font dir="ltr">6,11-16.</font>@@@@@But you, man of God, pursue righteousness, devotion, faith, love, patience, and gentleness.<br /><br />
Compete well for the faith. Lay hold of eternal life, to which you were called when you made the noble confession in the presence of many witnesses.<br /><br />
I charge (you) before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate for the noble confession,<br /><br />
to keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ<br /><br />
that the blessed and only ruler will make manifest at the proper time, the King of kings and Lord of lords,<br /><br />
who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, and whom no human being has seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal power. Amen.<br />
