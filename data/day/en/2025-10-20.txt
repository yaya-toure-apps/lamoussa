<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Use goods without abusing them</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Mercy and kindness are the friends of God. And if they come to settle in the heart of a man, they divinise it and model it to the resemblance of the sovereign Good so that it is the image of the primary Essance and without mixing He who surpasses all knowledge. <br /><br /><br />
You therefore, reasonable and endowed creatures of intelligence that interprets and teaches divine things, do not be seduced by temporal things. Instead, try to win the One who possesses eternity. Limit yourself to the use of the goods of life. Not everything belongs to you. Leave one part for the poor who are loved by God. Because everything is of God, our common Father, and we are brothers, the fairest ideal would be that everyone has an equal part of the inheritance. But failing this, if some take the biggest portion of this inheritance, that all the others obtain at least a part. And if someone wants to have it entirely to the exclusion of his many brothers, this one is a ruthless tyrant, a heartless barbaric, an insatiable beast. <br /><br /><br />
So use earthly goods, but do not abuse them.<br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">4,20-25.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: Abraham did not doubt Godâ€™s promise in unbelief; rather, he was empowered by faith and gave glory to God<br /><br />
and was fully convinced that what he had promised he was also able to do.<br /><br />
That is why &quot;it was credited to him as righteousness.&quot;<br /><br />
But it was not for him alone that it was written that &quot;it was credited to him&quot;;<br /><br />
it was also for us, to whom it will be credited, who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,<br /><br />
who was handed over for our transgressions and was raised for our justification.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">1,69-70.71-72.73-75.</font>@@@@@He has come to the help of his people and set them free.<br /><br />
He has raised up for us a mighty savior, <br /><br />
Born of the house of his servant David.
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br /><br />
that he would save us from our enemies, <br /><br />
from the hands of all who hate us.<br /><br />
He promised to show mercy to our fathers <br /><br />
and to remember his holy covenant.
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br /><br />
to set us free from the hands of our enemies, <br /><br />
free to worship him without fear,<br /><br />
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">12,13-21.</font>@@@@@Someone in the crowd said to Jesus, &quot;Teacher, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me.&quot;<br /><br />
He replied to him, &quot;Friend, who appointed me as your judge and arbitrator?&quot;<br /><br />
Then he said to the crowd, &quot;Take care to guard against all greed, for though one may be rich, one&#039;s life does not consist of possessions.&quot;<br /><br />
Then he told them a parable. &quot;There was a rich man whose land produced a bountiful harvest.<br /><br />
He asked himself, &#039;What shall I do, for I do not have space to store my harvest?&#039;<br /><br />
And he said, &#039;This is what I shall do: I shall tear down my barns and build larger ones. There I shall store all my grain and other goods<br /><br />
and I shall say to myself, &quot;Now as for you, you have so many good things stored up for many years, rest, eat, drink, be merry!&quot;<br /><br />
But God said to him, &#039;You fool, this night your life will be demanded of you; and the things you have prepared, to whom will they belong?&#039;<br /><br />
Thus will it be for the one who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich in what matters to God.&quot;<br />
