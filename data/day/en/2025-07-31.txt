<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Vigilant asceticism of the righteous</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
‘My spirit is extinguished,’ by the fear of judgment; in that the minds of the Elect, the more they feel themselves to be approaching the final Judgment, tremble so much the more fearfully in the searching of their own selves; and if they ever find in themselves any carnal thoughts, they consume them by the fervour of their penance; nor do they suffer their thoughts to expand with carnal delight, in that they pass sentence and inflict punishment on themselves more rigorously in proportion as they are awaiting the strict Judge close at hand.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Whence it comes to pass, that they look upon their departure as always near.  For the minds of the lost do many things wickedly on this account, because they suppose themselves living here for long; and so ‘the spirit of the righteous is wasted to thinness,’ but the spirit of the wicked is thickened.  For in proportion as they swell out in self-elation, they have not the wearing down of the spirit: but the righteous, whilst they consider the shortness of their life, eschew the sins of pride and impurity.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
For he that bethinks himself what he will be in death, is always rendered fearful in practice, and from the very cause that henceforth he does not as it were live in his own eyes, he does genuinely live in the eyes of his Creator. ... the righteous diligently living thus  escape the snares of sins.  Whence it is written, &quot;Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember thy latter end, and thou shalt never do amiss.&quot; [Ecclus. 7, 36] <br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">40,16-21.34-38.</font>@@@@@Moses did exactly as the LORD had commanded him.<br /><br />
On the first day of the first month of the second year the Dwelling was erected.<br /><br />
It was Moses who erected the Dwelling. He placed its pedestals, set up its boards, put in its bars, and set up its columns.<br /><br />
He spread the tent over the Dwelling and put the covering on top of the tent, as the LORD had commanded him.<br /><br />
He took the commandments and put them in the ark; he placed poles alongside the ark and set the propitiatory upon it.<br /><br />
He brought the ark into the Dwelling and hung the curtain veil, thus screening off the ark of the commandments, as the LORD had commanded him.<br /><br />
Then the cloud covered the meeting tent, and the glory of the LORD filled the Dwelling.<br /><br />
Moses could not enter the meeting tent, because the cloud settled down upon it and the glory of the LORD filled the Dwelling.<br /><br />
Whenever the cloud rose from the Dwelling, the Israelites would set out on their journey.<br /><br />
But if the cloud did not lift, they would not go forward; only when it lifted did they go forward.<br /><br />
In the daytime the cloud of the LORD was seen over the Dwelling; whereas at night, fire was seen in the cloud by the whole house of Israel in all the stages of their journey.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">84(83),3.4.5-6a.8a.11.</font>@@@@@My soul yearns and pines <br /><br />
for the courts of the LORD. <br /><br />
My heart and my flesh <br /><br />
cry out for the living God.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Even the sparrow finds a home, <br /><br />
and the swallow a nest <br /><br />
in which she puts her young? <br /><br />
Your altars, O LORD of hosts, <br /><br />
my king and my God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are they who dwell in your house! <br /><br />
Continually they praise you.<br /><br />
Blessed the men whose strength you are!<br /><br />
They go from strength to strength.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I had rather one day in your courts <br /><br />
than a thousand elsewhere; <br /><br />
I had rather lie at the threshold of the house of my God <br /><br />
than dwell in the tents of the wicked.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13,47-53.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to the disciples: “The Kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea, which collects fish of every kind.<br /><br />
When it is full they haul it ashore and sit down to put what is good into buckets. What is bad they throw away.<br /><br />
Thus it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous<br /><br />
and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.<br /><br />
Do you understand all these things? They answered, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br /><br />
And he replied, &quot;Then every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household who brings from his storeroom both the new and the old.&quot;<br /><br />
When Jesus finished these parables, he went away from there.<br />
