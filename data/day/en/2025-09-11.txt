<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Charity covers a multitude of sins</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
For, if we had charity, with compassion and pain, we would hesitate to observe our neighbour’s defects, as it is written: ‘Charity covers a multitude of sins,’ and again:<br /><br />
‘Charity does not take any account of evils, it bears all things,’ and so on. As for us then, if – as I was saying – we have charity, that charity should cover every fault, as is the case with the saints when they see people’s faults.<br /><br /><br />
I mean, are the saints blind? Do they not see sins? Indeed, who hates sin as much as the saints do? But nevertheless, they do not hate the sinner; they do not condemn him; they do not turn away from him. Rather, they show him sympathy; they admonish him; they entreat him. They seek to heal him, they do everything they can to save him.  It is like a mother who has an unsightly son. She does not despise him or turnaway from him, but dresses him beautifully and does everything she can to get him to<br /><br />
look more graceful. So the saints are always protecting, sorting out and giving assistance to anyone who stumbles, setting him straight at the right time, so that he doesn’t do any harm to anyone else, and they themselves also progress in the love of Christ. <br /><br /><br />
Let us too get some of this love for ourselves; let us acquire compassion for our neighbour, so that we may be saved from this dreadful business of speaking ill of people,<br /><br />
or condemning them, or setting them at nought. Do all we can in thought and deed to help ourselves and each other. For we are members of one another, as the Apostle says. For if we are all one body, and if we are all members of one another, each in his own way, then if one member suffers, all of the members suffer together with it.<br />

Letter to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">3,12-17.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: Put on, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,<br /><br />
bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if one has a grievance against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do.<br /><br />
And over all these put on love, that is, the bond of perfection.<br /><br />
And let the peace of Christ control your hearts, the peace into which you were also called in one body. And be thankful.<br /><br />
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, as in all wisdom you teach and admonish one another, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.<br /><br />
And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">150(149),1-2.3-4.5-6.</font>@@@@@Praise the LORD in his sanctuary, <br /><br />
Praise him in the firmament of his strength.<br /><br />
Praise him for his mighty deeds, <br /><br />
Praise him for his sovereign majesty.
Praise him with the blast of the trumpet, <br /><br />
Praise him with lyre and harp,<br /><br />
Praise him with timbrel and dance, <br /><br />
Praise him with strings and pipe.
Praise him with sounding cymbals, <br /><br />
Praise him with clanging cymbals.<br /><br />
Let everything that has breath <br /><br />
Praise the LORD! Alleluia.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">6,27-38.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his disciples : &quot;To you who hear I say, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,<br /><br />
bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.<br /><br />
To the person who strikes you on one cheek, offer the other one as well, and from the person who takes your cloak, do not withhold even your tunic.<br /><br />
Give to everyone who asks of you, and from the one who takes what is yours do not demand it back.<br /><br />
Do to others as you would have them do to you.<br /><br />
For if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.<br /><br />
And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same.<br /><br />
If you lend money to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit (is) that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, and get back the same amount.<br /><br />
But rather, love your enemies and do good to them, and lend expecting nothing back; then your reward will be great and you will be children of the Most High, for he himself is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.<br /><br />
Be merciful, just as (also) your Father is merciful.<br /><br />
Stop judging and you will not be judged. Stop condemning and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.<br /><br />
Give and gifts will be given to you; a good measure, packed together, shaken down, and overflowing, will be poured into your lap. For the measure with which you measure will in return be measured out to you.&quot;<br />
