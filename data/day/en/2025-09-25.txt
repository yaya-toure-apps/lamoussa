<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Herod kept trying to see Jesus</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
The prophets indicated beforehand that God should be seen by us, as the Lord also says: &quot;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God&quot; (Mt 5,8).  But in respect to his greatness, and his wonderful glory: &quot;no one shall see God and live&quot; (Ex 33,20),  for the Father is incomprehensible. But in regard to his love and kindness, and as to his infinite power, he grants even this to those who love him, namely, to see God - which the prophets also predicted. &quot;For those things that are impossible to us are possible with God&quot; (Lk 18,27).
For we do not see God by our own powers; but when God pleases he will be seen by those whom he wills, and when he wills, and as he wills. For God is powerful in all things. Indeed, having been seen formerly according to prophecy through the mediation of the Spirit, and seen, too, adoptively through the Son, he shall also be seen paternally in the kingdom of heaven, the Spirit truly preparing us beforehand for the Son of God, and the Son leading us to the Father, while the Father, too, confers incorruption upon us for eternal life, which comes to everyone from the fact of seeing God. For as those who see the light are within the light and partake of its brilliancy, so those who see God are in God and receive of his splendor. But his splendor is vivifying. Therefore those who see God participate in his life.<br />

Book of Haggai <font dir="ltr">1,1-8.</font>@@@@@On the first day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius, The word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai to the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and to the high priest Joshua, son of Jehozadak:<br /><br />
Thus says the LORD of hosts: This people says: &quot;Not now has the time come to rebuild the house of the LORD.&quot;<br /><br />
(Then this word of the LORD came through Haggai, the prophet:)<br /><br />
Is it time for you to dwell in your own paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?<br /><br />
Now thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways!<br /><br />
You have sown much, but have brought in little; you have eaten, but have not been satisfied; You have drunk, but have not been exhilarated; have clothed yourselves, but not been warmed; and he who earned wages earned them for a bag with holes in it.<br /><br />
Thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways!<br /><br />
Go up into the hill country; bring timber, and build the house That I may take pleasure in it and receive my glory, says the LORD.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">149(148),1-2.3-4.5-6a.9b.</font>@@@@@Sing to the LORD a new song <br /><br />
of praise in the assembly of the faithful.<br /><br />
Let Israel be glad in their maker, <br /><br />
let the children of Zion rejoice in their king.
Let them praise his name in the festive dance, <br /><br />
let them sing praise to him with timbrel and harp.<br /><br />
For the LORD loves his people, <br /><br />
and he adorns the lowly with victory.
Let the faithful exult in glory; <br /><br />
let them sing for joy upon their couches;<br /><br />
Let the high praises of God be in their throats.<br /><br />
This is the glory of all his faithful. Alleluia!<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">9,7-9.</font>@@@@@Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed because some were saying, &quot;John has been raised from the dead&quot; ;<br /><br />
others were saying, &quot;Elijah has appeared&quot;; still others, &quot;One of the ancient prophets has arisen.&quot;<br /><br />
But Herod said, &quot;John I beheaded. Who then is this about whom I hear such things?&quot; And he kept trying to see him.<br />
