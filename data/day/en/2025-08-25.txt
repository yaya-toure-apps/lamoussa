<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">God calls upon our freedom</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            God urges man to rise from sin (...). The more promptly man recognizes his misery, the sooner he humbles himself and abandons himself to God, knowing that it belongs to God to carry out this work of conversion within him. He becomes aware of it little by little through the continual inspirations that God sends him, and seeing the work and benefit he gains from it he says within himself:&nbsp; “It truly seems to me that God has nothing else to do but to take care of me. Oh! How sweet and full of love are the works of God upon us!” (...)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Even in this life, to serve God is truly to reign. When God delivers man from the sin that enslaves him, He frees him from all bondage and establishes him in true freedom. Otherwise, man always goes from desire to desire without ever finding peace;&nbsp;the more he has the more he wants;&nbsp;seeking to satisfy himself, he is never content. Indeed, whoever has a desire is possessed by it;&nbsp;to that thing he loves, he has sold himself;&nbsp;seeking his freedom, following his appetites in offense against God, he makes himself an endless slave.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Consider then the strength and power of our free will which holds within itself two things so opposed and contrary to one another:&nbsp;eternal life or eternal death. It cannot be forced by any creature if it does not wish it;&nbsp;therefore, as long as it is in your power, reflect well and take heed of what you do.<br />

First Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians <font dir="ltr">1:1-5,8b-10.</font>@@@@@Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the Church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace.<br /><br />
At every moment we give thanks to God for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers. Without ceasing,<br /><br />
we remember that your faith is active, that your charity labors, that your hope is steadfast in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of God our Father.<br /><br />
We know, beloved brothers of God, that you have been chosen by Him.<br /><br />
Indeed, our proclamation of the Gospel did not come to you in word alone, but in power, in the action of the Holy Spirit, in full certainty:&nbsp;you know how we conducted ourselves among you for your sake.<br /><br />
The news of your faith in God has spread everywhere so well that we do not need to speak of it.<br /><br />
In fact, people tell about the welcome we received among you;&nbsp;they say how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God,<br /><br />
and to await His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the coming wrath.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">149(148):1-2,3-4,5-6a,9b.</font>@@@@@Sing to the Lord a new song,<br /><br />
praise Him in the assembly of His faithful!<br /><br />
In Israel, joy for its Creator;<br /><br />
in Zion, rejoicing for its King!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Dance in praise of His name,<br /><br />
play for Him, tambourines and lyres!<br /><br />
For the Lord loves His people,<br /><br />
He crowns the humble with victory.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Let the faithful exult in glory,<br /><br />
shouting for joy at the time of triumph.<br /><br />
Let them proclaim the praises of God,<br /><br />
it is the pride of His faithful ones.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">23:13,15-22.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said:<br /><br />
“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you lock the kingdom of heaven before men;&nbsp;you yourselves do not enter, nor do you allow those who want to enter to go in!<br /><br />
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you traverse sea and land to make a single convert, and when it happens, you make him a child of Gehenna, twice as much as yourselves!<br /><br />
Woe to you, blind guides, who say:&nbsp;‘If one swears by the Sanctuary, it means nothing;&nbsp;but if one swears by the gold of the Sanctuary, he is bound by his oath.’<br /><br />
Fools and blind! Which is greater:&nbsp;the gold? or the Sanctuary that makes the gold sacred?<br /><br />
You also say:&nbsp;‘If one swears by the altar, it means nothing;&nbsp;but if one swears by the offering placed on the altar, he is bound by his oath.’<br /><br />
Blind ones! Which is greater:&nbsp;the offering? or the altar that makes the offering sacred?<br /><br />
Therefore whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it;&nbsp;<br /><br />
whoever swears by the Sanctuary swears by it and by Him who dwells in it;&nbsp;<br /><br />
and whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.”<br />
