<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The good use of riches</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Oh Jesus, I know that love is repaid with love alone, and I have searched and found the way to soothe my heart by returning to you Love for Love. “Make friends for yourselves through your use of this world&#039;s goods, so that when they fail you, a lasting reception will be yours.” (Lk 16:9) That is the advice you gave your disciples, Lord, after telling them that “the children of darkness are more capable of looking after their affairs than the children of light.” As a child of light, I understood that my desire to be everything, to embrace every vocation, was a wealth that could easily make me unrighteous, so I used it to make friends for myself. I remembered Elisha&#039;s request of his father Elijah when he dared to ask him for a “double portion of his spirit” (2 Kings 2:9), and I came before the angels and saints and told them: “I am the smallest of creatures, I know my poverty and weakness, but I also know how much noble and generous hearts love to do good. So I beg you, Oh blessed inhabitants of Heaven, I beg you to adopt me as your child. To you alone will be the glory that you let me acquire, but deign to hear my prayer. It is foolhardy, I know, however I dare to ask you to obtain for me a double portion of your Love. <br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">15,14-21.</font>@@@@@I myself am convinced about you, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to admonish one another.<br /><br />
But I have written to you rather boldly in some respects to remind you, because of the grace given me by God<br /><br />
to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in performing the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the holy Spirit.<br /><br />
In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to boast in what pertains to God.<br /><br />
For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to lead the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed,<br /><br />
by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit (of God), so that from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum I have finished preaching the gospel of Christ.<br /><br />
Thus I aspire to proclaim the gospel not where Christ has already been named, so that I do not build on another&#039;s foundation,<br /><br />
but as it is written: &quot;Those who have never been told of him shall see, and those who have never heard of him shall understand.&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">98(97),1.2-3ab.3cd-4.</font>@@@@@Sing to the LORD a new song, <br /><br />
for he has done wondrous deeds; <br /><br />
His right hand has won victory for him, <br /><br />
his holy arm.
The LORD has made his salvation known: <br /><br />
in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice.<br /><br />
He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness<br /><br />
toward the house of Israel.
All the ends of the earth have seen<br /><br />
the salvation by our God.<br /><br />
Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands; <br /><br />
break into song; sing praise.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">16,1-8.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his disciples, &quot;A rich man had a steward who was reported to him for squandering his property.<br /><br />
He summoned him and said, &#039;What is this I hear about you? Prepare a full account of your stewardship, because you can no longer be my steward.&#039;<br /><br />
The steward said to himself, &#039;What shall I do, now that my master is taking the position of steward away from me? I am not strong enough to dig and I am ashamed to beg.<br /><br />
I know what I shall do so that, when I am removed from the stewardship, they may welcome me into their homes.&#039;<br /><br />
He called in his master&#039;s debtors one by one. To the first he said, &#039;How much do you owe my master?&#039;<br /><br />
He replied, &#039;One hundred measures of olive oil.&#039; He said to him, &#039;Here is your promissory note. Sit down and quickly write one for fifty.&#039;<br /><br />
Then to another he said, &#039;And you, how much do you owe?&#039; He replied, &#039;One hundred kors of wheat.&#039; He said to him, &#039;Here is your promissory note; write one for eighty.&#039;<br /><br />
And the master commended that dishonest steward for acting prudently. &quot;For the children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.&quot;<br />
