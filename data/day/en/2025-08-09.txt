      Every human soul is in itself a temple of God: this opens up to us a vast and entirely new perspective. Jesus’ life of prayer is the key to understanding the prayer of the Church. Christ participated in his people’s worship of God that was done [in the Temple] publicly and according to the precepts of the Law… He established a very close relationship between that liturgy and his offering of himself, and thus he gave it its full and true sense, that of creation’s homage of thanksgiving to its Creator. By that very fact, he brought the liturgy of the old Covenant to fulfillment in that of the new Covenant.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      But Jesus not only took part in the public worship prescribed by the Law. The gospels refer even more frequently to his solitary prayer in the silence of the night, on the wild summits of the mountains, in deserted places (Mt 14:23; Mk 1:35: etc.). Forty days and forty nights of prayer preceded the public life of Jesus (Mk 4:1f.). He withdrew to the solitude of the mountain to pray before choosing his twelve apostles (Lk 6:12) and sending them on their mission. At the hour of the Mount of Olives, he prepared to go to Golgotha. His cry to the Father at that most painful hour of his life is revealed to us in a few brief words. His words there… are like lightning, illuminating for us for an instant the most intimate life of Jesus’ soul, the unfathomable mystery of his being as man-God and of his dialogue with the Father.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      That dialogue certainly lasted his entire life without ever being interrupted. Christ prayed interiorly not only when he withdrew away from the crowd, but also when he remained in the midst of people.<br />

Book of Deuteronomy <font dir="ltr">6,4-13.</font>@@@@@Moses said to the people: &quot;Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD alone!<br /><br />
Therefore, you shall love the LORD, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength.<br /><br />
Take to heart these words which I enjoin on you today.<br /><br />
Drill them into your children. Speak of them at home and abroad, whether you are busy or at rest.<br /><br />
Bind them at your wrist as a sign and let them be as a pendant on your forehead.<br /><br />
Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates.<br /><br />
&quot;When the LORD, your God, brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that he would give you, a land with fine, large cities that you did not build,<br /><br />
with houses full of goods of all sorts that you did not garner, with cisterns that you did not dig, with vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant; and when, therefore, you eat your fill,<br /><br />
take care not to forget the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.<br /><br />
The LORD, your God, shall you fear; him shall you serve, and by his name shall you swear.&quot;<br />

Praised be the LORD, I exclaim, <br /><br />
and I am safe from my enemies.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The LORD lives! And blessed be my rock! <br /><br />
Extolled be God my savior.<br /><br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">17,14-20.</font>@@@@@A man approached Jesus, knelt down before him,<br /><br />
and said, &quot;Lord, have pity on my son, for he is a lunatic and suffers severely; often he falls into fire, and often into water.<br /><br />
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus said in reply, &quot;O faithless and perverse generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him here to me.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus rebuked him and the demon came out of him, and from that hour the boy was cured.<br /><br />
Then the disciples approached Jesus in private and said, &quot;Why could we not drive it out?&quot;<br /><br />
He said to them, &quot;Because of your little faith. Amen, I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, &#039;Move from here to there,&#039; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.&quot;<br />
