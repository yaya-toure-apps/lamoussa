<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Take from me, O Lord, my heart of stone</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
It is for us to love Christ as he loved us. In this he left us an example so that we might follow in his steps (1Pt 2,21). This is why he says: “Set me as a seal upon your arm” (Sg 8,6). Is is as if he said: “Love me as I love you. Have me in your mind, your memory, your desire, your yearning, your sighing and your sobbing. Remember, mankind, how I made you, how I put you before all other creatures, how I ennobled you with such dignity, how I crowned you with glory and honor, how I made you only a little less than the angels, how I subjected all things under your feet (Ps 8). Remember, too, not only the many things I made for you, but what harsh and undeserved things I endured for you... If you love me, show me that you love me! Love me in deed and in truth, not with the word and the tongue... Set me as a seal upon your heart that you may love me with all your strength”...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Take from me, O Lord, my heart of stone. Take away my hardened heart...; give me a new heart, a heart of flesh, a pure heart! (Ez 36,26). You who purify the heart, you who love the pure heart, possess my heart and dwell within it.<br />

First Letter to the Thessalonians <font dir="ltr">2,9-13.</font>@@@@@You recall, brothers and sisters, our toil and drudgery. Working night and day in order not to burden any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.<br /><br />
You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved toward you believers.<br /><br />
As you know, we treated each one of you as a father treats his children,<br /><br />
exhorting and encouraging you and insisting that you conduct yourselves as worthy of the God who calls you into his kingdom and glory.<br /><br />
And for this reason we too give thanks to God unceasingly, that,in receiving the word of God from hearing us, you received not as a human word but, as it truly is, the word of God, which is now at work in you who believe.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">139(138),7-8.9-10.11-12ab.</font>@@@@@Where can I go from your spirit? <br /><br />
from your presence where can I flee?<br /><br />
If I go up to the heavens, you are there; <br /><br />
if I sink to the nether world, you are present there.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If I take the wings of the dawn, <br /><br />
if I settle at the farthest limits of the sea,<br /><br />
even there your hand shall guide me, <br /><br />
and your right hand hold me fast.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If I say, “Surely the darkness shall hide me, <br /><br />
and night shall be my light”–<br /><br />
For you darkness itself is not dark,<br /><br />
and night shines as the day.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">23,27-32.</font>@@@@@Jesus said, “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead men&#039;s bones and every kind of filth.<br /><br />
Even so, on the outside you appear righteous, but inside you are filled with hypocrisy and evildoing.<br /><br />
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the memorials of the righteous,<br /><br />
and you say, &#039;If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have joined them in shedding the prophets&#039; blood.&#039;<br /><br />
Thus you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who murdered the prophets;<br /><br />
now fill up what your ancestors measured out!&quot;<br />
