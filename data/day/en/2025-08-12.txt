<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">That which gives pleasure to God</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
	Imagine, my Sisters, what pleasure God takes in contemplating a soul who takes care to please him, scrupulous about offering to him whatever she is about to undertake? Oh, it&#039;s unimaginable, Sisters, and we are only too right to say that it gives God joy! Ah yes, this is his joy, his pleasure, his delight! It is like the child who is eager to take to his father everything given him; if someone gives him something, he cannot rest until he has found his father: &quot;Look, father; see what I&#039;ve got; I&#039;ve been given this; I&#039;ve done that.&quot; And the father takes unspeakable pleasure at seeing this child&#039;s obedience and little signs of love and dependence.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	Dearest Sisters, it is just the same with God and to an even higher degree. When a soul says to him first thing in the morning: &quot;Oh my God, I offer you everything that will happen to me today&quot;, and when, in addition, on those principal occasions for doing or suffering that arise, it glances towards his Divine Majesty to say wordlessly: &quot;See, oh my God, what I am about to do for your love alone. This meeting is a nuisance and difficult to bear, but for love of you nothing is impossible for me&quot;, then, daughters, God increases his grace insofar as his goodness sees the use the soul makes of it. And if it has the strength to overcome some difficulty today then, tomorrow, it will have enough to pass over some other, or many more, even greater and more annoying ones.<br /><br />

Book of Deuteronomy <font dir="ltr">31,1-8.</font>@@@@@When Moses had finished speaking these words to all Israel,<br /><br />
he said to them, &quot;I am now one hundred and twenty years old and am no longer able to move about freely; besides, the LORD has told me that I shall not cross this Jordan.<br /><br />
It is the LORD, your God, who will cross before you; he will destroy these nations before you, that you may supplant them. (It is Joshua who will cross before you, as the LORD promised.)<br /><br />
The LORD will deal with them just as he dealt with Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites whom he destroyed, and with their country.<br /><br />
When, therefore, the LORD delivers them up to you, you must deal with them exactly as I have ordered you.<br /><br />
Be brave and steadfast; have no fear or dread of them, for it is the LORD, your God, who marches with you; he will never fail you or forsake you.&quot;<br /><br />
Then Moses summoned Joshua and in the presence of all Israel said to him, &quot;Be brave and steadfast, for you must bring this people into the land which the LORD swore to their fathers he would give them; you must put them in possession of their heritage.<br /><br />
It is the LORD who marches before you; he will be with you and will never fail you or forsake you. So do not fear or be dismayed.&quot;<br />

Book of Deuteronomy <font dir="ltr">32,3-4a.7.8.9.12.</font>@@@@@For I will sing the LORD’s renown. <br /><br />
Oh, proclaim the greatness of our God!<br /><br />
The Rock–how faultless are his deeds, <br /><br />
how right all his ways!<br /><br />
Think back on the days of old, <br /><br />
reflect on the years of age upon age. <br /><br />
Ask your father and he will inform you, <br /><br />
ask your elders and they will tell you.<br /><br />
When the Most High assigned the nations their heritage, <br /><br />
when he parceled out the descendants of Adam, <br /><br />
He set up the boundaries of the peoples <br /><br />
after the number of the sons of Israel.<br /><br />
While the LORD’s own portion was Jacob, <br /><br />
his hereditary share was Israel.<br /><br />
The LORD alone was their leader, <br /><br />
no strange god was with him.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">18,1-5.10.12-14.</font>@@@@@The disciples approached Jesus and said, &quot;Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?&quot;<br /><br />
He called a child over, placed it in their midst,<br /><br />
and said, &quot;Amen, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.<br /><br />
Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.<br /><br />
And whoever receives one child such as this in my name receives me.<br /><br />
See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my heavenly Father.<br /><br />
What is your opinion? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the hills and go in search of the stray?<br /><br />
And if he finds it, amen, I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not stray.<br /><br />
In just the same way, it is not the will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones be lost.”<br />
