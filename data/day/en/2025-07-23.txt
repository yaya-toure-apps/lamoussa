<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Be witnesses of My Glory!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
God does not content Himself with being the object of a natural knowledge and love on man&#039;s part, but He calls us to share His very life and His own beatitude. By a movement of infinite love towards us, God wishes to be for our souls not only the Sovereign Master of all things, but a Friend, a Father. It is His will that we should know<br /><br />
Him as He knows Himself, the source of all truth and of all beauty. It is His Will that we should possess Him, the Infinite Good, here below in the dimness of faith, and above in the light of glory.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
To this end, as you know, He raises our nature above itself by adorning it with sanctifying grace, infused virtues and the gifts of the Spirit. God wills, by the communication of His infinite and eternal life, to be Himself our perfect beatitude. He does not wish us to find our happiness apart from Himself, the plenitude of all good ; He leaves to no creature the power of satisfying our heart.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It is I myself who am thy reward exceeding great. And Our Lord confirmed His promise when about to pay the price thereof by the sacrifice of His Precious Blood.<br /><br />
&quot; Father, I will that where I am,.they also whom Thou hast given Me may be with Me ; that they may see My glory... that the love wherewith Thou hast loved me, may be in them.&quot; (Jn 17:24,26) Such is the unique and supreme end to which we must tend.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">16,1-5.9-15.</font>@@@@@The children of Israel set out from Elim, and came into the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.<br /><br />
Here in the desert the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.<br /><br />
The Israelites said to them, &quot;Would that we had died at the LORD&#039;S hand in the land of Egypt, as we sat by our fleshpots and ate our fill of bread! But you had to lead us into this desert to make the whole community die of famine!&quot;<br /><br />
Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;I will now rain down bread from heaven for you. Each day the people are to go out and gather their daily portion; thus will I test them, to see whether they follow my instructions or not.<br /><br />
On the sixth day, however, when they prepare what they bring in, let it be twice as much as they gather on the other days.&quot;<br /><br />
Then Moses said to Aaron, &quot;Tell the whole Israelite community: Present yourselves before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.&quot;<br /><br />
When Aaron announced this to the whole Israelite community, they turned toward the desert, and lo, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud!<br /><br />
The LORD spoke to Moses and said,<br /><br />
&quot;I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them: In the evening twilight you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread, so that you may know that I, the LORD, am your God.&quot;<br /><br />
In the evening quail came up and covered the camp. In the morning a dew lay all about the camp,<br /><br />
and when the dew evaporated, there on the surface of the desert were fine flakes like hoarfrost on the ground.<br /><br />
On seeing it, the Israelites asked one another, &quot;What is this?&quot; for they did not know what it was. But Moses told them, &quot;This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">78(77),18-19.23-24.25-26.27-28.</font>@@@@@They tempted God in their hearts <br /><br />
by demanding the food they craved.<br /><br />
Yes, they spoke against God, saying, <br /><br />
“Can God spread a table in the desert?”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He commanded the skies above <br /><br />
and the doors of heaven he opened;<br /><br />
He rained manna upon them for food <br /><br />
and gave them heavenly bread.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Man ate the bread of angels, <br /><br />
food he sent them in abundance.<br /><br />
He stirred up the east wind in the heavens, <br /><br />
and by his power brought on the south wind.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
And he rained meat upon them like dust, <br /><br />
and, like the sand of the sea, winged fowl,<br /><br />
Which fell in the midst of their camp <br /><br />
round about their tents.  <br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13,1-9.</font>@@@@@On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat down by the sea.<br /><br />
Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd stood along the shore.<br /><br />
And he spoke to them at length in parables, saying: &quot;A sower went out to sow.<br /><br />
And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path, and birds came and ate it up.<br /><br />
Some fell on rocky ground, where it had little soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep,<br /><br />
and when the sun rose it was scorched, and it withered for lack of roots.<br /><br />
Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.<br /><br />
But some seed fell on rich soil, and produced fruit, a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold.<br /><br />
Whoever has ears ought to hear.&quot;<br />
