<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">A love without equal, after that of Christ</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
The martyrdom of the Virgin is suggested both by the prophecy of Simeon and by the very narrative of the passion of the Lord. &quot;This one,&quot; said the old man speaking of the child Jesus, &quot;will be a sign of contradiction, and yourself,&quot; he added to Mary, a sword will pierce her soul &quot;(Lk 2, 34-35). Yes, blessed mother, your soul, a sword pierced her, and besides, it was only by penetrating her that he entered the flesh of your son. In fact, when your Jesus - which is everyone&#039;s, but especially yours - had returned His Spirit, the cruel lance did not reach its soul. If, not saving him - even dead - it opened the his side, it could no longer cause Him pain. But your soul, it pierced: at that moment, hers was no longer there, but yours could not turn away from him. (…) <br /><br /><br />
Maybe someone will say, &quot;Didn&#039;t she know in advance that she should die?&quot; Yes, undoubtedly. &quot;Wasn&#039;t she hoping to see him resurrect immediately?&quot; Yes, with confidence. &quot;After that, she suffered when he was crucified?&quot; Certainly, and with what violence! So who are you therefore, brother, and where does equivalent wisdom come from to surprise you more of the compassion of Mary, than from the passion of the son of Mary? He could die from the death of the body and she could not have died with him in heart? There, it is the work of a love that no one surpasses; Here, it is the result of a love that after the first has never had its equal.<br />

Letter to the Hebrews <font dir="ltr">5,7-9.</font>@@@@@In the days when Christ Jesus was in the flesh, he offered prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.<br /><br />
Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered;<br /><br />
and when he was made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">31(30),2-3a.3bc-4.5-6.15-16.20.</font>@@@@@In you, O LORD, I take refuge; <br /><br />
let me never be put to shame. <br /><br />
In your justice rescue me,<br /><br />
Make haste to deliver me!  
Be my rock of refuge,<br /><br />
a stronghold to give me safety.  <br /><br />
You are my rock and my fortress; <br /><br />
for your name&#039;s sake you will lead and guide me.
You will free me from the snare they set for me, <br /><br />
for you are my refuge.<br /><br />
Into your hands I commend my spirit; <br /><br />
You will redeem me, O LORD, O faithful God.
But my trust is in you, O LORD; <br /><br />
I say, &quot;You are my God.<br /><br />
In your hands is my destiny; rescue me <br /><br />
from the clutches of my enemies and my persecutors.&quot;
How great is the goodness, O LORD, <br /><br />
which you have in store for those who fear you, <br /><br />
and which, toward those who take refuge in you, <br /><br />
You show in the sight of the children of men.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John <font dir="ltr">19,25-27.</font>@@@@@Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother&#039;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.<br /><br />
When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, &quot;Woman, behold, your son.&quot;<br /><br />
Then he said to the disciple, &quot;Behold, your mother.&quot; And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.<br />
