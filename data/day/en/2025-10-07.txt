<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly…, be killed and, on the third day, be raised” (Mt 16,21)</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
	Our Lord said that his disciples were blessed because of what they saw (Lk 10,23). Looking at the matter closely, we ought to be just as blessed as they were since we see Our Lord Jesus Christ more perfectly than disciples such as Saint Peter or Saint John. They only had before their eyes a poor, weak, suffering and mortal man. Whereas, thanks to our holy and precious faith, we have knowledge of a God who is great, worshipful, powerful, Lord of heaven and earth and who made creation out of nothing. In contemplating this our eyes, yes, and our souls find eternal blessedness.
	Dear children, great theologians and university doctors debate the question of knowing which is of greater importance and esteem: knowledge or love? We, on the other hand, speak more readily of what the masters of life have to say, since when we reach heaven then shall we see well the truth about everything. Hasn’t Our Lord said: “Only one thing is necessary?” What is this one, necessary thing that is so necessary? The one, necessary thing is that you recognise your weakness and frailty. You can claim nothing of yourself; of yourself you are nothing. And it was on account of this one necessary thing that Our Lord underwent an anguish so great that he sweated blood. It was because we did not want to acknowledge this one thing that the Lord cried out on the cross: “O God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” (Mt 27,46). Yes indeed, it was necessary that the saviour, our one, necessary thing, should be completely forsaken by all men.
	Dear child, let go of everything that I myself and any master could teach: the active life, contemplation, lofty reflections, and study only that one thing necessary in such a way that it will be granted you. Then you will have worked well. This is the reason why Our Lord said: “Mary has chosen the better part,” yes, better than all. Truly, if you could gain it you would have gained everything: not just a part of the good, but all of it.<br /><br />

Book of Jonah <font dir="ltr">3,1-10.</font>@@@@@The word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time:<br /><br />
&quot;Set out for the great city of Nineveh, and announce to it the message that I will tell you.&quot;<br /><br />
So Jonah made ready and went to Nineveh, according to the LORD&#039;S bidding. Now Nineveh was an enormously large city; it took three days to go through it.<br /><br />
Jonah began his journey through the city, and had gone but a single day&#039;s walk announcing, &quot;Forty days more and Nineveh shall be destroyed,&quot;<br /><br />
when the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast and all of them, great and small, put on sackcloth.<br /><br />
When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, laid aside his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in the ashes.<br /><br />
Then he had this proclaimed throughout Nineveh, by decree of the king and his nobles: &quot;Neither man nor beast, neither cattle nor sheep, shall taste anything; they shall not eat, nor shall they drink water.<br /><br />
Man and beast shall be covered with sackcloth and call loudly to God; every man shall turn from his evil way and from the violence he has in hand.<br /><br />
Who knows, God may relent and forgive, and withhold his blazing wrath, so that we shall not perish.&quot;<br /><br />
When God saw by their actions how they turned from their evil way, he repented of the evil that he had threatened to do to them; he did not carry it out.<br />

LORD, hear my voice!<br /><br />
Let your ears be attentive<br /><br />
to my voice in supplication.
If you, O LORD, mark iniquities,<br /><br />
LORD, who can stand?<br /><br />
But with you is forgiveness,<br /><br />
But with you is forgiveness,
For with the LORD is kindness<br /><br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">10,38-42.</font>@@@@@Jesus entered a village where a woman whose name was Martha welcomed him.<br /><br />
She had a sister named Mary who sat beside the Lord at his feet listening to him speak.<br /><br />
Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him and said, &quot;Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me by myself to do the serving? Tell her to help me.&quot;<br /><br />
The Lord said to her in reply, &quot;Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things.<br /><br />
There is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her.&quot;<br />
