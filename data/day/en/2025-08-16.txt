<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">God’s tenderness towards children</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
God takes as much delight, my daughters, in seeing the service you offer to children as he does in their little babblings and even in their little cries and tears. Each one of those cries touches God’s heart with confusion. And you too, my dear Sisters, when you comfort them when they cry, giving them the attention they need for love of God and in honor of Our Lord’s childhood, aren’t you pleasing God? And isn’t God honored by the cries and wailings of these little ones? So take heart, my daughters! Love caring for these infants through whose mouths God receives perfect praise. It isn’t just me who says so, Sisters, but the prophet: “In the mouths of infants at the breast is your perfect praise.” Oh my daughters, so it is true since Holy Scripture says so.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
See how fortunate you are to care for these little ones who give God perfect praise and in whom God’s goodness takes such great pleasure, a pleasure that is, in a certain sense, just like that of mothers who have no greater consolation than to view the little acts of their children. They admire everything and love everything. In the same way that God, who is their father, takes great pleasure in all their little doings.<br />

Book of Joshua <font dir="ltr">24,14-29.</font>@@@@@Joshua gathered together all the tribes of Israel at Shechem, and addressed them, saying: &quot;Fear the LORD and serve him completely and sincerely. Cast out the gods your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.<br /><br />
If it does not please you to serve the LORD, decide today whom you will serve, the gods your fathers served beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose country you are dwelling. As for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.&quot;<br /><br />
But the people answered, &quot;Far be it from us to forsake the LORD for the service of other gods.<br /><br />
For it was the LORD, our God, who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, out of a state of slavery. He performed those great miracles before our very eyes and protected us along our entire journey and among all the peoples through whom we passed.<br /><br />
At our approach the LORD drove out (all the peoples, including) the Amorites who dwelt in the land. Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God.&quot;<br /><br />
Joshua in turn said to the people, &quot;You may not be able to serve the LORD, for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God who will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.<br /><br />
If, after the good he has done for you, you forsake the LORD and serve strange gods, he will do evil to you and destroy you.&quot;<br /><br />
But the people answered Joshua, &quot;We will still serve the LORD.&quot;<br /><br />
Joshua therefore said to the people, &quot;You are your own witnesses that you have chosen to serve the LORD.&quot; They replied, &quot;We are, indeed!&quot;<br /><br />
&quot;Now, therefore, put away the strange gods that are among you and turn your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.&quot;<br /><br />
Then the people promised Joshua, &quot;We will serve the LORD, our God, and obey his voice.&quot;<br /><br />
So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem,<br /><br />
which he recorded in the book of the law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was in the sanctuary of the LORD.<br /><br />
And Joshua said to all the people, &quot;This stone shall be our witness, for it has heard all the words which the LORD spoke to us. It shall be a witness against you, should you wish to deny your God.&quot;<br /><br />
Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his own heritage.<br /><br />
After these events, Joshua, son of Nun, servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">16(15),1-2a.5.7-8.11.</font>@@@@@Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;<br /><br />
I say to the LORD, &quot;My Lord are you.&quot;<br /><br />
O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup, <br /><br />
you it is who hold fast my lot.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I bless the LORD who counsels me; <br /><br />
even in the night my heart exhorts me.<br /><br />
I set the LORD ever before me; <br /><br />
with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
You will show me the path to life, <br /><br />
fullness of joys in your presence, <br /><br />
the delights at your right hand forever.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">19,13-15.</font>@@@@@Children were brought to Jesus that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked them,<br /><br />
but Jesus said, &quot;Let the children come to me, and do not prevent them; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&quot;<br /><br />
After he placed his hands on them, he went away.<br />
