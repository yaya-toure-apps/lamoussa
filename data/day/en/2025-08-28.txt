<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Increase each day your ardour for eternal life!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
One day when he had gone forth because all the monks had assembled to him and asked to hear words from him, he spoke to them in the Egyptian tongue as follows: &#039;The Scriptures are enough for instruction, but it is a good thing to encourage one another in the faith, and to stir up with words. Wherefore you, as children, carry that which you know to your father; and I as the elder share my knowledge and what experience has taught me with you. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Let this especially be the common aim of all, neither to give way having once begun, nor to faint in trouble, nor to say: We have lived in the discipline a long time: but rather as though making a beginning daily let us increase our earnestness. For the whole life of man is very short, measured by the ages to come, wherefore all our time is nothing compared with eternal life. And in the world everything is sold at its price, and a man exchanges one equivalent for another; but the promise of eternal life is bought for a trifle.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Though we fought on earth, we shall not receive our inheritance on earth, but we have the promises in heaven; and having put off the body which is corrupt, we shall receive it incorrupt. &#039;Wherefore, children, let us hold fast our discipline, and let us not be careless. For in it the Lord is our fellow-worker, as it is written, &quot;to all that choose the good, God worketh with them for the good.&quot;(Rm 8:28)<br />

First Letter to the Thessalonians <font dir="ltr">3,7-13.</font>@@@@@We have been reassured about you, brothers and sisters, in our every distress and affliction, through your faith.<br /><br />
For we now live, if you stand firm in the Lord.<br /><br />
What thanksgiving, then, can we render to God for you, for all the joy we feel on your account before our God?<br /><br />
Night and day we pray beyond measure to see you in person and to remedy the deficiencies of your faith.<br /><br />
Now may God himself, our Father, and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you,<br /><br />
and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we have for you,<br /><br />
so as to strengthen your hearts, to be blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones. Amen.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">90(89),3-4.12-13.14.17.</font>@@@@@You turn man back to dust, <br /><br />
saying, &quot;Return, O children of men.&quot;<br /><br />
For a thousand years in your sight <br /><br />
are as yesterday, now that it is past, <br /><br />
or as a watch of the night.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Teach us to number our days aright, <br /><br />
that we may gain wisdom of heart.<br /><br />
Return, O LORD! How long? <br /><br />
Have pity on your servants!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Fill us at daybreak with your kindness, <br /><br />
that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days.<br /><br />
And may the gracious care of the LORD our God be ours; <br /><br />
Prosper the work of our hands for us! <br /><br />
Prosper the work of our hands!<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">24,42-51.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his disciples: &quot;Stay awake! For you do not know on which day your Lord will come.<br /><br />
Be sure of this: if the master of the house had known the hour of night when the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not let his house be broken into.<br /><br />
So too, you also must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.<br /><br />
Who, then, is the faithful and prudent servant, whom the master has put in charge of his household to distribute to them their food at the proper time?<br /><br />
Blessed is that servant whom his master on his arrival finds doing so.<br /><br />
Amen, I say to you, he will put him in charge of all his property.<br /><br />
But if that wicked servant says to himself, &#039;My master is long delayed,&#039;<br /><br />
and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with drunkards,<br /><br />
the servant&#039;s master will come on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour<br /><br />
and will punish him severely and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.&quot;<br />
