<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Behold I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way before you" (Mt 11:10; Ml 3:1)</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
“The memory of the just is praised” (Pr 10:7), but thou art well pleased, O Forerunner, with the testimony of the Lord. For thou has verily been shown forth as more honored than the prophets (Mt 11:9), since thou wast counted worthy to baptize in the stream him whom they foretold. Therefore, having mightily contended and suffered for the truth, with joy thou has preached also to those in hell the good things of God made manifest in the flesh, who takes away the sin of the world (1Tm 3:16; Jn 1:29) and grants us great mercy.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
By the will of God hast thou come forth from the womb of a barren woman; thou hast broken the bonds of thy father&#039;s tongue (Lk 1:7.64); thou hast shown us the Sun who enlightens thee, O thou, the star of morning. In the desert hast thou preached to the people of their Creator, of the lamb that takes away the sin of the world. In thy zeal hast thou rebuked the king and thy glorious head was severed, O thou, illustrious Forerunner, truly worthy of our songs. Intercede with Christ our God that he might grant forgiveness for all their sins to those who, with heartfelt devotion, celebrate thy holy memory.<br />

Book of Leviticus <font dir="ltr">25,1.8-17.</font>@@@@@The LORD said to Moses on Mount Sinai,<br /><br />
&quot;Seven weeks of years shall you count--seven times seven years--so that the seven cycles amount to forty-nine years.<br /><br />
Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month let the trumpet resound; on this, the Day of Atonement, the trumpet blast shall re-echo throughout your land.<br /><br />
This fiftieth year you shall make sacred by proclaiming liberty in the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when every one of you shall return to his own property, every one to his own family estate.<br /><br />
In this fiftieth year, your year of jubilee, you shall not sow, nor shall you reap the aftergrowth or pick the grapes from the untrimmed vines.<br /><br />
Since this is the jubilee, which shall be sacred for you, you may not eat of its produce, except as taken directly from the field.<br /><br />
&quot;In this year of jubilee, then, every one of you shall return to his own property.<br /><br />
Therefore, when you sell any land to your neighbor or buy any from him, do not deal unfairly.<br /><br />
On the basis of the number of years since the last jubilee shall you purchase the land from him; and so also, on the basis of the number of years for crops, shall he sell it to you.<br /><br />
When the years are many, the price shall be so much the more; when the years are few, the price shall be so much the less. For it is really the number of crops that he sells you.<br /><br />
Do not deal unfairly, then; but stand in fear of your God. I, the LORD, am your God.&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">67(66),2-3.5.7-8.</font>@@@@@May God have pity on us and bless us; <br /><br />
may he let his face shine upon us.<br /><br />
So may your way be known upon earth; <br /><br />
among all nations, your salvation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
May the nations be glad and exult <br /><br />
because you rule the peoples in equity; <br /><br />
the nations on the earth you guide.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The earth has yielded its fruits; <br /><br />
God, our God, has blessed us.<br /><br />
May God bless us, <br /><br />
and may all the ends of the earth fear him!<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">14,1-12.</font>@@@@@Herod the tetrarch heard of the reputation of Jesus<br /><br />
and said to his servants, &quot;This man is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why mighty powers are at work in him.&quot;<br /><br />
Now Herod had arrested John, bound (him), and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip,<br /><br />
for John had said to him, &quot;It is not lawful for you to have her.&quot;<br /><br />
Although he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, for they regarded him as a prophet.<br /><br />
But at a birthday celebration for Herod, the daughter of Herodias performed a dance before the guests and delighted Herod<br /><br />
so much that he swore to give her whatever she might ask for.<br /><br />
Prompted by her mother, she said, &quot;Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.&quot;<br /><br />
The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and the guests who were present, he ordered that it be given,<br /><br />
and he had John beheaded in the prison.<br /><br />
His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who took it to her mother.<br /><br />
His disciples came and took away the corpse and buried him; and they went and told Jesus.<br />
