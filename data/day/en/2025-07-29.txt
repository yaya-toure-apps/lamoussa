<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Whoever believes in me will live”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      “Whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live; and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.” What is being said? “Whoever believes in me, even if he is dead like Lazarus, will live” because God is not God of the dead but God of the living. Already, concerning Abraham, Isaac and Jacob those long-dead patriarchs, Jesus had given the same reply: “He is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob; he is not God of the dead but of the living, for to him all are alive” (Lk 20:37-38). Believe, then; and though you were dead, you will live! But if you do not believe, then although you may be living, actually, you are dead. (...) From where comes death in the soul? From the fact that faith is no longer there. From where comes the death of the body? From the fact that the soul is no longer there. The soul&#039;s soul is faith.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      	“Whoever believes in me, even though he die in body will be alive in soul until the body itself rises again to die no more. And whoever lives in the flesh and believes in me, although he must die in his body for a season, will not die for ever because of the life of the Spirit and immortality of the resurrection.”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     	That is what Jesus&#039; reply to Martha meant (...): “Do you believe this?” “Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I have come to believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who is coming into the world. Believing this, I have believed you are the resurrection; I have believed you are the life; I have believed that whoever believes in you, though he die, will live; I have believed that whoever lives and believes in you will never die eternally.”<br />

First Letter of John <font dir="ltr">4,7-16.</font>@@@@@Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God; everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God.<br /><br />
Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love.<br /><br />
In this way the love of God was revealed to us: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him.<br /><br />
In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins.<br /><br />
Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another.<br /><br />
No one has ever seen God. Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in us.<br /><br />
This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us, that he has given us of his Spirit.<br /><br />
Moreover, we have seen and testify that the Father sent his Son as savior of the world.<br /><br />
Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him and he in God.<br /><br />
We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us. God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">34(33),2-3.4-5.6-7.8-9.10-11.</font>@@@@@I will bless the LORD at all times; <br /><br />
his praise shall be ever in my mouth.<br /><br />
Let my soul glory in the LORD; <br /><br />
the lowly will hear me and be glad.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Glorify the LORD with me, <br /><br />
let us together extol his name.<br /><br />
I sought the LORD, and he answered me <br /><br />
and delivered me from all my fears.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Look to him that you may be radiant with joy, <br /><br />
and your faces may not blush with shame.<br /><br />
When the poor one called out, the LORD heard, <br /><br />
and from all his distress he saved him.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The angel of the LORD encamps <br /><br />
around those who fear him, and delivers them.<br /><br />
Taste and see how good the LORD is; <br /><br />
blessed the man who takes refuge in him.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Fear the LORD, you his holy ones, <br /><br />
for nought is lacking to those who fear him.<br /><br />
The great grow poor and hungry; <br /><br />
but those who seek the LORD want for no good thing.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John <font dir="ltr">11,19-27.</font>@@@@@Many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them about their brother [Lazarus, who had died].<br /><br />
When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat at home.<br /><br />
Martha said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.<br /><br />
But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, &quot;Your brother will rise.&quot;<br /><br />
Martha said to him, &quot;I know he will rise, in the resurrection on the last day.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus told her, &quot;I am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live,<br /><br />
and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?&quot;<br /><br />
She said to him, &quot;Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who is coming into the world.&quot;<br />
