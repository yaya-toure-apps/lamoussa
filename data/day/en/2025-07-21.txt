<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The sign of Jonah</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      	See how the prophet Jonah&#039;s flight away from God (Jon 1,3) is transformed into a prophetic image, and what was described as a fatal shipwreck is turned into the sign of the Lord&#039;s Resurrection. The very text of the story of Jonah clearly shows him to be a perfect image of our Savior. It is written that Jonah “fled from before the face of God.” And did not our Lord himself flee from the condition and appearance of the divine nature to assume the condition and appearance of man? This is how the apostle Paul puts it: “Though he was divine he did not regard equality with God something to be grasped but emptied himself, taking the condition of a slave” (Phil 2,6-7). He who is Lord put on the condition of a slave; to go unrecognised in the world, to conquer the devil, he fled from himself within man... God is everywhere: it is impossible to flee from him. To “flee far away from the face of God” Christ hid himself, not spatially, but as it were through appearance - under the appearance of our slavery, which he wholly assumed.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     	The text then continues: “Jonah went down to Joppa to escape to Tarshish.” This is the person who came down: “No one has gone up to heaven except the one who has come down from heaven” (Jn 3,13). Our Lord came down from heaven to earth; God came down to man; the almighty has come down to our servitude. But the Jonah who came down to the ship had to go up for the voyage; so too Christ, after coming down to this world, went up into the ship of the Church through his virtues and miracles.<br /><br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">14,5-18.</font>@@@@@When it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants changed their minds about them. &quot;What have we done!&quot; they exclaimed. &quot;Why, we have released Israel from our service!&quot;<br /><br />
So Pharaoh made his chariots ready and mustered his soldiers--<br /><br />
six hundred first-class chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt, with warriors on them all.<br /><br />
So obstinate had the LORD made Pharaoh that he pursued the Israelites even while they were marching away in triumph.<br /><br />
The Egyptians, then, pursued them; Pharaoh&#039;s whole army, his horses, chariots and charioteers, caught up with them as they lay encamped by the sea, at Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.<br /><br />
Pharaoh was already near when the Israelites looked up and saw that the Egyptians were on the march in pursuit of them. In great fright they cried out to the LORD.<br /><br />
And they complained to Moses, &quot;Were there no burial places in Egypt that you had to bring us out here to die in the desert? Why did you do this to us? Why did you bring us out of Egypt?<br /><br />
Did we not tell you this in Egypt, when we said, &#039;Leave us alone. Let us serve the Egyptians&#039;? Far better for us to be the slaves of the Egyptians than to die in the desert.&quot;<br /><br />
But Moses answered the people, &quot;Fear not! Stand your ground, and you will see the victory the LORD will win for you today. These Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again.<br /><br />
The LORD himself will fight for you; you have only to keep still.&quot;<br /><br />
Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward.<br /><br />
And you, lift up your staff and, with hand outstretched over the sea, split the sea in two, that the Israelites may pass through it on dry land.<br /><br />
But I will make the Egyptians so obstinate that they will go in after them. Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and charioteers.<br /><br />
The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I receive glory through Pharaoh and his chariots and charioteers.&quot;<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">15,1-2.3-4.5-6.</font>@@@@@I will sing to the LORD, for he is gloriously triumphant; <br /><br />
horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.<br /><br />
My strength and my courage is the LORD, <br /><br />
and he has been my savior. <br /><br />
He is my God, I praise him; <br /><br />
the God of my father, I extol him.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The LORD is a warrior, <br /><br />
LORD is his name!<br /><br />
Pharaoh&#039;s chariots and army he hurled into the sea; <br /><br />
the elite of his officers were submerged in the Red Sea.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The flood waters covered them, <br /><br />
they sank into the depths like a stone.<br /><br />
Your right hand, O LORD, magnificent in power, <br /><br />
your right hand, O LORD, has shattered the enemy.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">12,38-42.</font>@@@@@Some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus, &quot;Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.&quot;<br /><br />
He said to them in reply, &quot;An evil and unfaithful generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.<br /><br />
Just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.<br /><br />
At the judgment, the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and there is something greater than Jonah here.<br /><br />
At the judgment the queen of the south will arise with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and there is something greater than Solomon here.&quot;<br />
