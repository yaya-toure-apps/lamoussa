Let no one who is Christian doubt that even now dead people rise. Certainly, every human being has eyes by which he can see dead people rising in the way this widow&#039;s son whom we just heard about in the gospel rose. But not everyone can see people who are spiritually dead rise. For that, it is necessary to have already risen interiorly. It is greater to raise someone who is to live forever than to raise someone who will have to die again.
The young man&#039;s mother, this widow, was transported with joy at seeing her son rise. Our mother the Church also rejoices when she sees her children&#039;s spiritual resurrection every day. The widow&#039;s son was dead with the death of the body; but these latter are dead with the death of the soul. People wept tears over the visible death of the former; but people were not concerned by the invisible death of the latter; they didn&#039;t even see it. The only one who did not remain indifferent is the one who knew these deaths; only the one who could give life back to them knew these deaths. For if the Lord had not come to raise the dead, the apostle Paul would not have said: “Awake, O sleeper, arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light.” (Eph 5:14)<br /><br />

First Letter to Timothy <font dir="ltr">3,1-13.</font>@@@@@Beloved, this saying is trustworthy: whoever aspires to the office of bishop desires a noble task.<br /><br />
Therefore, a bishop must be irreproachable, married only once, temperate, self-controlled, decent, hospitable, able to teach,<br /><br />
not a drunkard, not aggressive, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money.<br /><br />
He must manage his own household well, keeping his children under control with perfect dignity;<br /><br />
for if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how can he take care of the church of God?<br /><br />
He should not be a recent convert, so that he may not become conceited and thus incur the devil&#039;s punishment.<br /><br />
He must also have a good reputation among outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, the devil&#039;s trap.<br /><br />
Similarly, deacons must be dignified, not deceitful, not addicted to drink, not greedy for sordid gain,<br /><br />
holding fast to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.<br /><br />
Moreover, they should be tested first; then, if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.<br /><br />
Women, similarly, should be dignified, not slanderers, but temperate and faithful in everything.<br /><br />
Deacons may be married only once and must manage their children and their households well.<br /><br />
Thus those who serve well as deacons gain good standing and much confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">101(100),1b-2ab.2cd-3ab.5.6.</font>@@@@@Of mercy and judgment I will sing; <br /><br />
to you, O LORD, I will sing praise.<br /><br />
I will persevere in the way of integrity;<br /><br />
when will you come to me?
I will walk with blameless heart,<br /><br />
within my house;<br /><br />
I will not set before my eyes<br /><br />
any base thing.
Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, <br /><br />
him will I destroy. <br /><br />
The man of haughty eyes and puffed up heart <br /><br />
I will not endure.
My eyes are upon the faithful of the land, <br /><br />
that they may dwell with me. <br /><br />
He who walks in the way of integrity <br /><br />
shall be in my service.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">7,11-17.</font>@@@@@Jesus journeyed to a city called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd accompanied him.<br /><br />
As he drew near to the gate of the city, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the city was with her.<br /><br />
When the Lord saw her, he was moved with pity for her and said to her, &quot;Do not weep.&quot;<br /><br />
He stepped forward and touched the coffin; at this the bearers halted, and he said, &quot;Young man, I tell you, arise!&quot;<br /><br />
The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.<br /><br />
Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, exclaiming, &quot;A great prophet has arisen in our midst,&quot; and &quot;God has visited his people.&quot;<br /><br />
This report about him spread through the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region.<br />
