<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Blest are your eyes because they see and blest are your ears because they hear.”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
A tree that has been uprooted, even cut down to its base, and then replanted – a willow, for example – grows and blossoms again; and can it be that a human being who has been uprooted from the earth should not live again? Seeds that have been harvested rest, sleep in the granary and come back to life in the spring; and can it be that a human being who has been harvested and thrown into the granary of death should not live again? A bud on the vine, a branch that has been cut and transplanted, these come back to life and bear fruit; and can it be that a human being, for whom everything was created, should not rise again when he has fallen?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
And look at what is going on around you. Meditate on what you see in this vast universe. I sow wheat or some other seed; it falls, it rots, and can no longer serve as our food. But from its rotten state it is born again, it rises, it multiplies. I sowed only a single seed and I gather twenty or thirty more. But who was it created for? Wasn&#039;t it made for our use? All those seeds did not come out of nothing for their own sake. So what was created for us dies and is born again, and should we, for whom this marvel is worked every day, be excluded from this benefit? How is it possible to believe that we have no resurrection?<br /><br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">19,1-2.9-11.16-20b.</font>@@@@@In the third month after their departure from the land of Egypt, on its first day, the Israelites came to the desert of Sinai.<br /><br />
After the journey from Rephidim to the desert of Sinai, they pitched camp. While Israel was encamped here in front of the mountain,<br /><br />
The LORD also told him, &quot;I am coming to you in a dense cloud, so that when the people hear me speaking with you, they may always have faith in you also.&quot; When Moses, then, had reported to the LORD the response of the people,<br /><br />
the LORD added, &quot;Go to the people and have them sanctify themselves today and tomorrow. Make them wash their garments<br /><br />
and be ready for the third day; for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai before the eyes of all the people.<br /><br />
On the morning of the third day there were peals of thunder and lightning, and a heavy cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled.<br /><br />
But Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stationed themselves at the foot of the mountain.<br /><br />
Mount Sinai was all wrapped in smoke, for the LORD came down upon it in fire. The smoke rose from it as though from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently.<br /><br />
The trumpet blast grew louder and louder, while Moses was speaking and God answering him with thunder.<br /><br />
When the LORD came down to the top of Mount Sinai, he summoned Moses to the top of the mountain.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13,10-17.</font>@@@@@The disciples approached Jesus and said, &quot;Why do you speak to them in parables?&quot;<br /><br />
He said to them in reply, &quot;Because knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been granted to you, but to them it has not been granted.<br /><br />
To anyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; from anyone who has not, even what he has will be taken away.<br /><br />
This is why I speak to them in parables, because &#039;they look but do not see and hear but do not listen or understand.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />
Isaiah&#039;s prophecy is fulfilled in them, which says: &#039;You shall indeed hear but not understand you shall indeed look but never see.<br /><br />
Gross is the heart of this people, they will hardly hear with their ears, they have closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and be converted, and I heal them.&#039;<br /><br />
But blessed are your eyes, because they see, and your ears, because they hear.<br /><br />
Amen, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it&quot;.<br />
