<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Happy he who places  the beginning and the end of his works in God!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
It would be better for you that you feel useless and a sinner than being lukewarm ... If you understood that you are a sinner, you would tear yourself away from the bad actions ... But you are like a lukewarm breeze that does not bring humidity to the fruit and do not give them warmth. <br /><br /><br />
You are the one who begins and not the one who completes, you touch the good at the beginning, May you do not feed on him in his completion, similar to a wind which caresses the face, but which does not nourish the belly. What is better, a vain noise or a work brought to term? ... Consequently, act in the silence of humility and do not rise with pride, because it will be counted for nothing that which strives to obtain with a pride of fire what it disdains to accomplish in the abandonment of love. <br /><br /><br />
Vain and fools, those who place their confidence in themselves ... Those who, in their pride, put their confidence in themselves, wish to appear more wise than their fathers and do not want to walk according to their pact, but, in their great instability, give themselves laws according to their whims ... because what sometimes seems good to men by an error of their mind, when they are not intensely warmed by the breath of the Holy Spirit will go to death, because it came from a vain glory. (…) <br /><br /><br />
Happy who, having confidence in me, places his hope, and the beginning and the end of his works, not in him, but in me. This one will not fall. But who will want to hold without me will go to ruin.<br />

Book of Wisdom <font dir="ltr">2,23-24.3,1-9.</font>@@@@@God formed man to be imperishable; the image of his own nature he made him.<br /><br />
But by the envy of the devil, death entered the world, and they who are in his possession experience it.<br /><br />
But the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment shall touch them.<br /><br />
They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead; and their passing away was thought an affliction<br /><br />
and their going forth from us, utter destruction. But they are in peace.<br /><br />
For if before men, indeed, they be punished, yet is their hope full of immortality;<br /><br />
Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed, because God tried them and found them worthy of himself.<br /><br />
As gold in the furnace, he proved them, and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself.<br /><br />
In the time of their visitation they shall shine, and shall dart about as sparks through stubble;<br /><br />
They shall judge nations and rule over peoples, and the LORD shall be their King forever.<br /><br />
Those who trust in him shall understand truth, and the faithful shall abide with him in love: Because grace and mercy are with his holy ones, and his care is with the elect.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">34(33),2-3.16-17.18-19.</font>@@@@@I will bless the LORD at all times; <br /><br />
his praise shall be ever in my mouth.<br /><br />
Let my soul glory in the LORD; <br /><br />
the lowly will hear me and be glad.
The LORD has eyes for the just, <br /><br />
And ears for their cry.<br /><br />
The LORD confronts the evildoers, <br /><br />
to destroy remembrance of them from the earth.
When the just cry out, the LORD hears them, <br /><br />
and from all their distress he rescues them.<br /><br />
The LORD is close to the brokenhearted; <br /><br />
and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">17,7-10.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to the Apostles: “Who among you would say to your servant who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field, ‘Come here immediately and take your place at table’?<br /><br />
Would he not rather say to him, &#039;Prepare something for me to eat. Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink. You may eat and drink when I am finished&#039;?<br /><br />
Is he grateful to that servant because he did what was commanded?<br /><br />
So should it be with you. When you have done all you have been commanded, say, &#039;We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we were obliged to do.&#039;&quot;<br />
