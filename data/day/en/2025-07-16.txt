<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
It is the Father to whom all existence owes its origin. In Christ and through Christ he is the source of all. In contrast to all else he is self-existent… He is infinite, for nothing contains Him and He contains all things… He is eternally anterior to time, for time is his creation. Let imagination range to what you may suppose is God&#039;s utmost limit, and you will find him present there; strain as you will there is always a further horizon towards which to strain... Such is the truth of the mystery of God; such is the expression of the incomprehensible nature of the Father… Let us confess by our silence that words cannot describe him; let sense admit that it is foiled in the attempt to apprehend, and reason in the effort to define. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Yet he has, as we said, in the word &#039;Father&#039; a name to indicate his nature; he is a Father unconditioned. He does not, as men do, receive the power of paternity from an external source. He is unbegotten,... To the Son only is he known, for “no one knows the Father save the Son and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal him,” and “no one knows the Son except the Father”. Each has perfect and complete knowledge of the Other. Therefore, since “no one knows the Father save the Son”, let our thoughts of the Father be at one with the thoughts of the Son, the only “faithful Witness” (Rv 1,5), who reveals him to us.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It is easier for me to feel this concerning the Father than to say it. I am well aware that no words are adequate to describe his attributes… All this is an acknowledgment of his glory, a hint of our meaning, a sketch of our thoughts, but speech is powerless to tell us what God is, words cannot express the reality… Therefore we may well acknowledge God but we must avoid naming him. Whatever words we use could not express God as he is nor translate his greatness... We must believe in him, must apprehend, must worship; and such acts of devotion must stand in lieu of definition.<br /><br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">3,1-6.9-12.</font>@@@@@Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. Leading the flock across the desert, he came to Horeb, the mountain of God.<br /><br />
There an angel of the LORD appeared to him in fire flaming out of a bush. As he looked on, he was surprised to see that the bush, though on fire, was not consumed.<br /><br />
So Moses decided, &quot;I must go over to look at this remarkable sight, and see why the bush is not burned.&quot;<br /><br />
When the LORD saw him coming over to look at it more closely, God called out to him from the bush, &quot;Moses! Moses!&quot; He answered, &quot;Here I am.&quot;<br /><br />
God said, &quot;Come no nearer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.<br /><br />
I am the God of your father,&quot; he continued, &quot;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.&quot; Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.<br /><br />
So indeed the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have truly noted that the Egyptians are oppressing them.<br /><br />
Come, now! I will send you to Pharaoh to lead my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.&quot;<br /><br />
But Moses said to God, &quot;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt?&quot;<br /><br />
He answered, &quot;I will be with you; and this shall be your proof that it is I who have sent you: when you bring my people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this very mountain.&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">103(102),1-2.3-4.6-7.</font>@@@@@Bless the LORD, O my soul; <br /><br />
and all my being, bless his holy name.<br /><br />
Bless the LORD, O my soul, <br /><br />
and forget not all his benefits.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He pardons all your iniquities, <br /><br />
he heals all your ills.<br /><br />
He redeems your life from destruction, <br /><br />
he crowns you with kindness and compassion.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The LORD secures justice <br /><br />
and the rights of all the oppressed.<br /><br />
He has made known his ways to Moses, <br /><br />
and his deeds to the children of Israel.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">11,25-27.</font>@@@@@At that time Jesus exclaimed, &quot;I give praise to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike.<br /><br />
Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.<br /><br />
All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.&quot;<br />
