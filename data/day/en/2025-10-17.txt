Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">4,1-8.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: What then can we say that Abraham found, our ancestor according to the flesh?<br /><br />
Indeed, if Abraham was justified on the basis of his works, he has reason to boast; but this was not so in the sight of God.<br /><br />
For what does the scripture say? &quot;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&quot;<br /><br />
A worker&#039;s wage is credited not as a gift, but as something due.<br /><br />
But when one does not work, yet believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.<br /><br />
So also David declares the blessedness of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:<br /><br />
&quot;Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered.<br /><br />
Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not record.&quot;<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">12,1-7.</font>@@@@@At that time: So many people were crowding together that they were trampling one another underfoot. He began to speak, first to his disciples, &quot;Beware of the leaven--that is, the hypocrisy--of the Pharisees.<br /><br />
There is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, nor secret that will not be known.<br /><br />
Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed on the housetops.<br /><br />
I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body but after that can do no more.<br /><br />
I shall show you whom to fear. Be afraid of the one who after killing has the power to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, be afraid of that one.<br /><br />
Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins? Yet not one of them has escaped the notice of God.<br /><br />
Even the hairs of your head have all been counted. Do not be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.&quot;<br />
