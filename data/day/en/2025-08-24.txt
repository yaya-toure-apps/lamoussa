<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">« Strive to enter through the narrow gate » (Lk 13:24)</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            We can have nothing stable in a world where we came only to pass through, and for us, to live is each day to leave life and to pass on. (…) <br /><br />
<br /><br />
            This mutability, man does not suffer it only in his body, but also in his soul, when he strives to rise toward the better. For under the weight of his mutability, the soul is constantly carried toward something other than what it is, and if it is not held in its first state by the strict discipline of vigilance, it constantly slips toward the worse. For in abandoning the One who remains forever, it has lost the stability it could have kept. Thus now its striving toward the better is nothing but an ascent against the current. And should it relax its intention to climb, behold, without effort it is brought back to the depths.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Yes, to ascend is effort and to descend is ease, and it is through the narrow gate that we shall enter, the Lord reminds us: “Strive, he says, to enter through the narrow gate.” (Lk 13:24) At the very moment when he is about to speak of entering through the narrow gate, he first says: “Strive,” for without fervent contention of the spirit, invincible is the tide of this world that constantly drives the soul back toward baseness.<br />

Book of Isaiah <font dir="ltr">66:18-21.</font>@@@@@Thus speaks the Lord:<br /><br />
knowing their deeds and their thoughts, I am coming to gather all nations, of every tongue. They shall come and see my glory:<br /><br />
I will set among them a sign! And from among them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Put and Lud, Meshech, Rosh, Tubal and Javan, to the distant coastlands that have never heard of my fame, that have never seen my glory; these survivors shall proclaim my glory among the nations.<br /><br />
And from all the nations they shall bring all your brothers as an offering to the Lord, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain, Jerusalem—says the Lord. Just as the sons of Israel bring their offering in pure vessels to the house of the Lord, so shall they be brought.<br /><br />
I will even take priests and Levites from among them, says the Lord.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">13:22-30.</font>@@@@@At that time, while he was making his way to Jerusalem, Jesus went through towns and villages teaching.<br /><br />
Someone asked him, “Lord, will only a few people be saved?” He said to them:<br /><br />
“Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for I tell you, many will attempt to enter but will not be strong enough.<br /><br />
After the master of the house has risen and locked the door, then if you stand outside knocking and saying, ‘Lord, open the door for us,’ he will say to you in reply, ‘I do not know where you are from.’<br /><br />
Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank in your company and you taught in our streets.’<br /><br />
But he will reply, ‘I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you evildoers!’<br /><br />
And there will be wailing and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves cast out.<br /><br />
And people will come from the east and the west and from the north and the south and will recline at table in the kingdom of God.<br /><br />
For behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”<br />

Letter to the Hebrews <font dir="ltr">12:5-7,11-13.</font>@@@@@Brothers, you have forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons: ‘My son, do not disdain the discipline of the Lord, or lose heart when he reproves you;<br /><br />
for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines; he scourges every son he acknowledges.’<br /><br />
Endure your trials as “discipline”; God treats you as sons. For what “son” is there whom his father does not discipline?<br /><br />
At the time, all discipline seems a cause not for joy but for pain, yet later it brings the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who are trained by it.<br /><br />
So strengthen your drooping hands and your weak knees,<br /><br />
and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated but healed.<br />
