<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"He who listens is like one who constructed a house" (Lk 6:47-48)</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Attend closely to the catechisings, and though we should prolong our discourse, let not your mind be wearied out. For you are receiving armour against the adverse power.... You have many enemies; take to you many darts, for you have many to hurl them at: and you have need to learn how to strike ..., how to contend ..., . And the armour is ready, and most ready the sword of the Spirit : but thou also must stretch forth your right hand with good resolution, that you may war the Lord&#039;s warfare, and overcome adverse powers, and become invincible against every heretical attempt.<br /><br /><br />
Imagine it is the season for planting trees: if we do not dig, and dig deep, when else can that be planted rightly which has once been planted ill? Suppose, pray, that the Catechising is a kind of building: if we do not bind the house together by regular bonds in the building, lest some gap be found, and the building become unsound, even our former labour is of no use. But stone must follow stone by course, and corner match with corner, and by our smoothing off inequalities the building must thus rise evenly. <br /><br /><br />
In like manner we are bringing to you stones, as it were, of knowledge. You must hear concerning the living God, you must hear of Judgment, must hear of Christ, and of the Resurrection. And many things there are to be discussed in succession. But unless thou fit them together in the one whole, and remember what is first, and what is second, the builder may build, but you will find the building unsound.<br /><br />

First Letter to Timothy <font dir="ltr">1,15-17.</font>@@@@@Beloved: This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Of these I am the foremost.<br /><br />
But for that reason I was mercifully treated, so that in me, as the foremost, Christ Jesus might display all his patience as an example for those who would come to believe in him for everlasting life.<br /><br />
To the king of ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">113(112),1-2.3-4.5a.6-7.</font>@@@@@Praise, you servants of the LORD, <br /><br />
praise the name of the LORD.<br /><br />
Blessed be the name of the LORD <br /><br />
both now and forever.
From the rising to the setting of the sun <br /><br />
is the name of the LORD to be praised.<br /><br />
High above all nations is the LORD; <br /><br />
above the heavens is his glory.
Who is like the LORD, our God,<br /><br />
who looks upon the heavens and the earth below?<br /><br />
He raises up the lowly from the dust; <br /><br />
from the dunghill he lifts up the poor.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">6,43-49.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his disciples : &quot;A good tree does not bear rotten fruit, nor does a rotten tree bear good fruit.<br /><br />
For every tree is known by its own fruit. For people do not pick figs from thornbushes, nor do they gather grapes from brambles.<br /><br />
A good person out of the store of goodness in his heart produces good, but an evil person out of a store of evil produces evil; for from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks.<br /><br />
Why do you call me, &#039;Lord, Lord,&#039; but not do what I command?<br /><br />
I will show you what someone is like who comes to me, listens to my words, and acts on them.<br /><br />
That one is like a person building a house, who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock; when the flood came, the river burst against that house but could not shake it because it had been well built.<br /><br />
But the one who listens and does not act is like a person who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against it, it collapsed at once and was completely destroyed.&quot;<br />
