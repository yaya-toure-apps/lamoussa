<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">God tirelessly calls us to conversion</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            Brothers, let us not remain in carelessness and laxity&nbsp;; let us not always lightly postpone to tomorrow or later the moment to begin our work. “Now is the acceptable time, says the apostle Paul, today is the day of salvation” (2Co 6:2). At present, it is the time of penance, later it will be the time of reward&nbsp;; now it is the time of perseverance, one day will come the time of consolation. Now God helps those who turn away from evil&nbsp;; later he will be the judge of men’s deeds, words, and thoughts. Today we profit from his patience&nbsp;; we shall know the justice of his judgments, at the resurrection, when we shall each receive according to our works.<br /><br />
<br />
            How long then shall we delay to obey Christ who calls us into his heavenly Kingdom&nbsp;? Shall we not purify ourselves&nbsp;? Shall we not resolve to abandon our habitual way of life to follow the Gospel to the end&nbsp;?<br />

First Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to Timothy <font dir="ltr">3:14-16.</font>@@@@@Beloved, I am writing to you with the hope of coming to see you soon.<br /><br />
But in case I am delayed, I want you to know how one ought to behave in the household of God, that is, the community, the Church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth.<br /><br />
Truly great is the mystery of our religion: Christ was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed in throughout the world, taken up in glory!<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">111(110),1-2.3-4.5-6.</font>@@@@@With all my heart I will give thanks to the Lord <br /><br />
in the assembly, among the upright.<br /><br />
Great are the works of the Lord; <br /><br />
all who love them ponder them.
Majesty and splendor are in his works: <br /><br />
his justice stands firm forever.<br /><br />
He has left a memorial of his wonders; <br /><br />
the Lord is gracious and merciful.
He has given food to those who fear him, <br /><br />
he is ever mindful of his covenant.<br /><br />
He has shown his power to his people, <br /><br />
giving them the heritage of the nations.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">7:31-35.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to the crowd: “To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?<br /><br />
They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another: ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance. We sang a dirge, and you did not weep.’<br /><br />
For John the Baptist has come, neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’<br /><br />
The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’<br /><br />
Yet wisdom is proved right by all her children.”<br />
