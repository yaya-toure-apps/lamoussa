“Rejoice in the Lord always” (Phil 4:4). And why, in fact, are you not filled with joy and do you not walk in gladness, since you have been judged worthy to be drawn into this evangelical state by the call which discerns and predestines (cf. Rom 8:29-30), call of the God who governs all things by his wisdom? <br /><br /><br />
And now that by the elevation of your way of life you are as if on a promontory, cast your eyes on the miserable and crawling life of men: it is as if tossed by the sea, projected here and there by the uncertain movement of affairs. In truth, nothing lasts, nothing remains in the same state, you see that well; but even kings pass away, princes fall, the mighty rulers of the earth die like mere mortals (cf. Ps 81:7); and those who have been married for a while separate, whether they abandon their spouse or are abandoned by them. Beauty soon withers, youth is fleeting, pleasure is fleeting; wealth dissipates and all possession, like the dream of a shadow, moves away from those who think they retain it. Only lamentation and mourning are found in the adversity and setbacks of mortals. (…) And almost no one fights for what is stable and durable (…). But you my brothers, oh! How and where were you called, and how did you ascend to the mountain of the Lord (cf. Ps 23:3)? How do you contemplate the wonders of heavenly life? (…) <br /><br /><br />
May it please therefore the God who brought you up to this promontory, to make you strong and establish you so that you always do what pleases him in holiness and justice (cf. Lk 1:75) (…). Therefore, fear only the living God (cf. Lk 12:5; Rev 14:7), my children!<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">98(97),5-6.7-8.9.</font>@@@@@Sing praise to the LORD with the harp, <br /><br />
with the harp and melodious song.<br /><br />
With trumpets and the sound of the horn <br /><br />
sing joyfully before the King, the LORD.
Let the sea and what fills it resound,<br /><br />
the world and those who dwell in it;<br /><br />
Let the rivers clap their hands, <br /><br />
The mountains shout with them for joy before the LORD.
The LORD comes, <br /><br />
He comes to rule the earth; <br /><br />
He will rule the world with justice <br /><br />
And the peoples with equity.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">21,5-19.</font>@@@@@While some people were speaking about how the temple was adorned with costly stones and votive offerings, Jesus said,<br /><br />
&quot;All that you see here--the days will come when there will not be left a stone upon another stone that will not be thrown down.&quot;<br /><br />
Then they asked him, &quot;Teacher, when will this happen? And what sign will there be when all these things are about to happen?&quot;<br /><br />
He answered, &quot;See that you not be deceived, for many will come in my name, saying, &#039;I am he,&#039; and &#039;The time has come.&#039; Do not follow them!<br /><br />
When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for such things must happen first, but it will not immediately be the end.&quot;<br /><br />
Then he said to them, &quot;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.<br /><br />
There will be powerful earthquakes, famines, and plagues from place to place; and awesome sights and mighty signs will come from the sky.&quot;<br /><br />
Before all this happens, however, they will seize and persecute you, they will hand you over to the synagogues and to prisons, and they will have you led before kings and governors because of my name.<br /><br />
It will lead to your giving testimony.<br /><br />
Remember, you are not to prepare your defense beforehand,<br /><br />
for I myself shall give you a wisdom in speaking that all your adversaries will be powerless to resist or refute.<br /><br />
You will even be handed over by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death.<br /><br />
You will be hated by all because of my name,<br /><br />
but not a hair on your head will be destroyed.<br /><br />
By your perseverance you will secure your lives.&quot;<br />

Second Letter to the Thessalonians <font dir="ltr">3,7-12.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: you know how one must imitate us. For we did not act in a disorderly way among you,<br /><br />
nor did we eat food received free from anyone. On the contrary, in toil and drudgery, night and day we worked, so as not to burden any of you.<br /><br />
Not that we do not have the right. Rather, we wanted to present ourselves as a model for you, so that you might imitate us.<br /><br />
In fact, when we were with you, we instructed you that if anyone was unwilling to work, neither should that one eat.<br /><br />
We hear that some are conducting themselves among you in a disorderly way, by not keeping busy but minding the business of others.<br /><br />
Such people we instruct and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and to eat their own food.<br />
