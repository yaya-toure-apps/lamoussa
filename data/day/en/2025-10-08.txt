Book of Jonah <font dir="ltr">4,1-11.</font>@@@@@Jonah was greatly displeased and became angry that God did not carry out the evil he threatened against Nineveh.<br /><br />
&quot;I beseech you, LORD,&quot; he prayed, &quot;is not this what I said while I was still in my own country? This is why I fled at first to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger, rich in clemency, loathe to punish.<br /><br />
And now, LORD, please take my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.&quot;<br /><br />
But the LORD asked, &quot;Have you reason to be angry?&quot;<br /><br />
Jonah then left the city for a place to the east of it, where he built himself a hut and waited under it in the shade, to see what would happen to the city.<br /><br />
And when the LORD God provided a gourd plant, that grew up over Jonah&#039;s head, giving shade that relieved him of any discomfort, Jonah was very happy over the plant.<br /><br />
But the next morning at dawn God sent a worm which attacked the plant, so that it withered.<br /><br />
And when the sun arose, God sent a burning east wind; and the sun beat upon Jonah&#039;s head till he became faint. Then he asked for death, saying, &quot;I would be better off dead than alive.&quot;<br /><br />
But God said to Jonah, &quot;Have you reason to be angry over the plant?&quot; &quot;I have reason to be angry,&quot; Jonah answered, &quot;angry enough to die.&quot;<br /><br />
Then the LORD said, &quot;You are concerned over the plant which cost you no labor and which you did not raise; it came up in one night and in one night it perished.<br /><br />
And should I not be concerned over Nineveh, the great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot distinguish their right hand from their left, not to mention the many cattle?&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">86(85),3-4.5-6.9-10.</font>@@@@@Have mercy on me, O Lord,<br /><br />
for to you I call all the day.<br /><br />
Gladden the soul of your servant, <br /><br />
for to you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, <br /><br />
abounding in kindness to all who call upon you.<br /><br />
Hearken, O LORD, to my prayer <br /><br />
and attend to the sound of my pleading.
All the nations you have made shall come<br /><br />
and worship you, O Lord,<br /><br />
and glorify your name.<br /><br />
For you are great, and you do wondrous deeds;<br /><br />
you alone are God.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">11,1-4.</font>@@@@@Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, &quot;Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.&quot;<br /><br />
He said to them, &quot;When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.<br /><br />
Give us each day our daily bread<br /><br />
and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive everyone in debt to us, and do not subject us to the final test.&quot;<br />
