Symbols of the Holy Spirit: Fire. While water signifies birth and the fruitfulness of life given in the Holy Spirit, fire symbolizes the transforming energy of the Holy Spirit&#039;s actions. The prayer of the prophet Elijah, who &quot;arose like fire&quot; (Sir 48,1) and whose &quot;word burned like a torch,&quot; brought down fire from heaven on the sacrifice on Mount Carmel. This event was a &quot;figure&quot; of the fire of the Holy Spirit, who transforms what he touches. John the Baptist, who goes &quot;before [the Lord] in the spirit and power of Elijah,&quot; (Lk 1,17) proclaims Christ as the one who &quot;will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire&quot; (Lk 3,16). Jesus will say of the Spirit: &quot;I came to cast fire upon the earth; and would that it were already kindled!&quot; In the form of tongues &quot;as of fire,&quot; the Holy Spirit rests on the disciples on the morning of Pentecost and fills them with himself (Acts 2,3-4). The spiritual tradition has retained this symbolism of fire as one of the most expressive images of the Holy Spirit&#039;s actions: &quot;Do not quench the Spirit&quot; (1Thes 5,19)...
Jesus does not reveal the Holy Spirit fully, until he himself has been glorified through his Death and Resurrection... Only when the hour has arrived for his glorification does Jesus promise the coming of the Holy Spirit, since his Death and Resurrection will fulfill the promise made to the fathers. The Spirit of truth, the other Paraclete, will be given by the Father in answer to Jesus&#039; prayer; he will be sent by the Father in Jesus&#039; name; and Jesus will send him from the Father&#039;s side, since he comes from the Father... At last Jesus&#039; hour arrives: he commends his spirit into the Father&#039;s hands118 at the very moment when by his death he conquers death, so that, &quot;raised from the dead by the glory of the Father&quot; (Rm 6,4), he might immediately give the Holy Spirit by &quot;breathing&quot; on his disciples (Jn 20,22).<br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">6,19-23.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your nature. For just as you presented the parts of your bodies as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness for lawlessness, so now present them as slaves to righteousness for sanctification.<br /><br />
For when you were slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.<br /><br />
But what profit did you get then from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.<br /><br />
But now that you have been freed from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit that you have leads to sanctification, and its end is eternal life.<br /><br />
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">1,1-2.3.4.6.</font>@@@@@Blessed the man who follows not <br /><br />
the counsel of the wicked <br /><br />
Nor walks in the way of sinners, <br /><br />
nor sits in the company of the insolent,<br /><br />
But delights in the law of the LORD <br /><br />
and meditates on his law day and night.
He is like a tree <br /><br />
planted near running water, <br /><br />
that yields its fruit in due season, <br /><br />
and whose leaves never fade. <br /><br />
Whatever he does, prospers.
Not so, the wicked, not so; <br /><br />
they are like chaff which the wind drives away.<br /><br />
For the LORD watches over the way of the just,<br /><br />
but the way of the wicked vanishes.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">12,49-53.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his disciples: “I have come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were already blazing!<br /><br />
There is a baptism with which I must be baptized, and how great is my anguish until it is accomplished!<br /><br />
Do you think that I have come to establish peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.<br /><br />
From now on a household of five will be divided, three against two and two against three;<br /><br />
a father will be divided against his son and a son against his father, a mother against her daughter and a daughter against her mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.&quot;<br />
