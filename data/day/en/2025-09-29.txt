<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"You will see the angels of God mount and descend on the Son of man"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
You have prepared the troops of angels and the divine armies to be the welcome dwellings and venerable receptacles of your divine splendor, the spectators of your glory, standing near your throne, powerfully and effectively executing your word and energetically fulfilling your commands, Lover of man.<br /><br /><br />
As you, who are good, wished to manifest the abyss of your goodness, O God without beginning, you first created, by your almighty power and divine order, the choirs of angels and the cohorts of Powers; for it was necessary, in truth, that good should spread and propagate, so that the beneficiaries of your goodness, O Master, might be more numerous.<br /><br /><br />
The six-winged Seraphim, the countless-eyed Cherubim, surround you with the sublime Thrones, participating without intermediary in your primordial splendor; The Dominations, the Principalities, the Powers, the Archangels, the Angels and the divine Virtues, acclaiming your glory, O Almighty, supplicate you on our behalf.<br />

Book of Daniel <font dir="ltr">7,9-10.13-14.</font>@@@@@As I watched : Thrones were set up and the Ancient One took his throne. His clothing was bright as snow, and the hair on his head as white as wool ; His throne was flames of fire, with wheels of burning fire.<br /><br />
A surging stream of fire flowed out from where he sat; Thousands upon thousands were ministering to him, and myriads upon myriads attended him. The court was convened, and the books were opened.<br /><br />
As the visions during the night continued, I saw One like a son of man coming, on the clouds of heaven; When he reached the Ancient One and was presented before him,<br /><br />
He received dominion, glory, and kingship; nations and peoples of every language serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not be taken away, his kingship shall not be destroyed.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">138(137),1-2a.2bc-3.4-5.</font>@@@@@I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with all my heart, <br /><br />
for you have heard the words of my mouth; <br /><br />
in the presence of the angels I will sing your praise;<br /><br />
I will worship at your holy temple.
I will give thanks to your name,<br /><br />
because of your kindness and your truth.<br /><br />
When I called, you answered me; <br /><br />
you built up strength within me.
All the kings of the earth shall give thanks to you, O LORD, <br /><br />
when they hear the words of your mouth;<br /><br />
and they shall sing of the ways of the LORD: <br /><br />
&quot;Great is the glory of the LORD.&quot;<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John <font dir="ltr">1,47-51.</font>@@@@@Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, &quot;Here is a true child of Israel. There is no duplicity in him.&quot;<br /><br />
Nathanael said to him, &quot;How do you know me?&quot; Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.&quot;<br /><br />
Nathanael answered him, &quot;Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this.&quot;<br /><br />
And he said to him, &quot;Amen, amen, I say to you, you will see the sky opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&quot;<br />
