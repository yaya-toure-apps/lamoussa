<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Have you come to destroy us?"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Angels and men, as intelligent and free creatures, have to journey toward their ultimate destinies by their free choice and preferential love. They can therefore go astray. Indeed, they have sinned. Thus has moral evil, incommensurably more harmful than physical evil, entered the world. God is in no way, directly or indirectly, the cause of moral evil.176 He permits it, however, because he respects the freedom of his creatures and, mysteriously, knows how to derive good from it… From the greatest moral evil ever committed - the rejection and murder of God&#039;s only Son, caused by the sins of all men - God, by his grace that &quot;abounded all the more&quot;, brought the greatest of goods: the glorification of Christ and our redemption. But for all that, evil never becomes a good.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
&quot;We know that in everything God works for good for those who love him.&quot; (Rm 8,28) The constant witness of the saints confirms this truth. St. Catherine of Siena said to &quot;those who are scandalized and rebel against what happens to them&quot;: &quot;Everything comes from love, all is ordained for the salvation of man, God does nothing without this goal in mind&quot;… And Dame Julian of Norwich: &quot;Here I was taught by the grace of God that I should steadfastly keep me in the faith... and that at the same time I should take my stand on and earnestly believe in what our Lord shewed in this time - that &#039;all manner (of) thing shall be well.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We firmly believe that God is master of the world and of its history. But the ways of his providence are often unknown to us. Only at the end, when our partial knowledge ceases, when we see God &quot;face to face&quot; (1 Cor 13:12), will we fully know the ways by which - even through the dramas of evil and sin - God has guided his creation to that definitive sabbath rest for which he created heaven and earth.<br /><br />

First Letter to the Thessalonians <font dir="ltr">5,1-6.9-11.</font>@@@@@Concerning times and seasons, brothers and sisters, you have no need for anything to be written to you.<br /><br />
For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief at night.<br /><br />
When people are saying, &quot;Peace and security,&quot; then sudden disaster comes upon them, like labor pains upon a pregnant woman,and they will not escape.<br /><br />
But you, brothers, are not in darkness, for that day to overtake you like a thief.<br /><br />
For all of you are children of the light and children of the day. We are not of the night or of darkness.<br /><br />
Therefore, let us not sleep as the rest do, but let us stay alert and sober.<br /><br />
For God did not destine us for wrath, but to gain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,<br /><br />
who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live together with him.<br /><br />
Therefore, encourage one another and build one another up, as indeed you do.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">27(26),1.4.13-14.</font>@@@@@The LORD is my light and my salvation; <br /><br />
whom should I fear? <br /><br />
The LORD is my life&#039;s refuge; <br /><br />
of whom should I be afraid?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
One thing I ask of the LORD <br /><br />
this I seek: <br /><br />
to dwell in the house of the LORD <br /><br />
all the days of my life, <br /><br />
that I may gaze on the loveliness of the LORD <br /><br />
and contemplate his temple.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
I believe that I shall see the bounty of the LORD <br /><br />
in the land of the living.<br /><br />
Wait for the LORD with courage; <br /><br />
be stouthearted, and wait for the LORD.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">4,31-37.</font>@@@@@Jesus then went down to Capernaum, a town of Galilee. He taught them on the sabbath,<br /><br />
and they were astonished at his teaching because he spoke with authority.<br /><br />
In the synagogue there was a man with the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out in a loud voice,<br /><br />
Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!<br /><br />
Jesus rebuked him and said, &quot;Be quiet! Come out of him!&quot; Then the demon threw the man down in front of them and came out of him without doing him any harm.<br /><br />
They were all amazed and said to one another, &quot;What is there about his word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.&quot;<br /><br />
And news of him spread everywhere in the surrounding region.<br />
