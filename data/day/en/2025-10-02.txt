<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">God has wanted to entrust our soul to a prince of the heavenly host</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Our soul is so noble, adorned with so many beautiful qualities, that the good Lord wanted to entrust it only to a prince of his heavenly court.<br /><br />
<br />
Our soul is so precious in the eyes of God Himself that, in all His wisdom, He found no food worthy of it but His adorable Body, which He wishes to make His daily bread; and for its drink, only His precious Blood was worthy of serving.<br /><br />
<br />
Yes, my brothers, if we have a soul that God esteems so much that, even if it had been alone in the world, He would not have thought it too much to die for it; and that, even if the good Lord, in creating it, had not created a heaven, although it was alone in the world, the good Lord would have created one for it alone.<br /><br />
<br />
O my body, how happy you are to house a soul adorned with so many beautiful qualities! A God, infinite as He is, makes it the object of His favor! Yes, my brothers, our soul is destined to spend its eternity in the bosom of God himself.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">23,20-23.</font>@@@@@&quot;See, I am sending an angel before you, to guard you on the way and bring you to the place I have prepared.<br /><br />
Be attentive to him and heed his voice. Do not rebel against him, for he will not forgive your sin. My authority resides in him.<br /><br />
If you heed his voice and carry out all I tell you, I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foes.<br /><br />
&quot;My angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and Jebusites; and I will wipe them out.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">91(90),1-2.3-4.5-6.10-11.</font>@@@@@You who dwell in the shelter of the Most High, <br /><br />
who abide in the shadow of the Almighty,<br /><br />
Say to the LORD, &quot;My refuge and my fortress, <br /><br />
my God, in whom I trust.&quot;
For he will rescue you from the snare of the fowler, <br /><br />
from the destroying pestilence.<br /><br />
With his pinions he will cover you, <br /><br />
and under his wings you shall take refuge.
You shall not fear the terror of the night <br /><br />
nor the arrow that flies by day,<br /><br />
nor the pestilence that roams in darkness, <br /><br />
nor the plague that ravages at noon.
No evil shall befall you, <br /><br />
nor shall affliction come near your tent,<br /><br />
for to his angels he has given command about you, <br /><br />
that they guard you in all your ways.<br />
