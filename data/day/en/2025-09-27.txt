<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Its meaning was hidden from them"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Of all Christ&#039;s miracles and mighty acts, it is this one that far exceeds the limits of human wonder. It goes far beyond the weak power of the human mind to perceive or comprehend how it is supposed to believe that the divine majesty, that very Word of the Father (Jn 1:1) and Wisdom of God in which &quot;all things were created, visible and invisible&quot; (cf. Col 1:15), was held within the confines of the man who appeared in Judaea and, even more, that the Wisdom of God entered into the womb of a woman and was born a baby who cried and wailed just like all little babies. And it is further reported that he suffered the anguish of death, as he himself admitted by saying: &quot;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death&quot; (Mt 26:38 par); and in the end he was led to that death which is reputed to be the most shameful among men, even though he did rise again on the third day... <br /><br /><br />
To present this to human ears and explain it in words far surpasses our poor merits... Indeed the explanation of this mystery is probably beyond the grasp even of the whole creation of heavenly powers.<br />

Book of Zechariah <font dir="ltr">2,5-9.14-15a.</font>@@@@@I, Zechariah, raised my eyes and looked: there was a man with a measuring line in his hand.<br /><br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; I asked. &quot;To measure Jerusalem,&quot; he answered; &quot;to see how great is its width and how great its length.&quot;<br /><br />
Then the angel who spoke with me advanced, and another angel came out to meet him,<br /><br />
and said to him, &quot;Run, tell this to that young man: People will live in Jerusalem as though in open country, because of the multitude of men and beasts in her midst.<br /><br />
But I will be for her an encircling wall of fire, says the LORD, and I will be the glory in her midst.&quot;<br /><br />
Sing and rejoice, O daughter Zion! See, I am coming to dwell among you, says the LORD.<br /><br />
Many nations shall join themselves to the LORD on that day, and they shall be his people, and he will dwell among you.<br />

Book of Jeremiah <font dir="ltr">31,10.11-12ab.13.</font>@@@@@Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, <br /><br />
Proclaim it on distant isles, and say: <br /><br />
He who scattered Israel, now gathers them together, <br /><br />
He guards them as a shepherd his flock.<br /><br />
The LORD shall ransom Jacob, <br /><br />
he shall redeem him from the hand of his conqueror.<br /><br />
Shouting, they shall mount the heights of Zion, <br /><br />
they shall come streaming to the LORD’s blessings:<br /><br />
Then the virgins shall make merry and dance, <br /><br />
and young men and old as well. <br /><br />
I will turn their mourning into joy, <br /><br />
I will console and gladden them after their sorrows.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">9,43b-45.</font>@@@@@While they were all amazed at his every deed, he said to his disciples,<br /><br />
&quot;Pay attention to what I am telling you. The Son of Man is to be handed over to men.&quot;<br /><br />
But they did not understand this saying; its meaning was hidden from them so that they should not understand it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.<br />
