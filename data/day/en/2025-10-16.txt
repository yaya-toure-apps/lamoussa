<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Repent, for the kingdom of God is close</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
I, Catherine, the slave of the servants of Jesus Christ, write to you in His Precious Blood, with the desire to see in you a true knowledge of yourself and your Creator. And this knowledge is necessary for our salvation, for all virtue comes from this holy knowledge.<br /><br /><br />
Where is true humility found? In self-knowledge; for the soul that recognizes that it is nothing, and that it derives its entire being from God, cannot raise its head in pride against its Creator, nor against its neighbor; for that which is nothing in itself cannot be proud. And where does the soul grieve over its fault? In self-knowledge, by piously considering who it is that has offended God, and which God it has offended. (…) Through our fault, we lose the life of grace and our dignity. (…) Why? Because we do not know what follows sin and where it leads us. For if we truly knew it, we would abandon vice and unruly habits and embrace virtue. Then we would honor God, we would preserve the beauty and dignity of our souls; we would follow the doctrine of truth, and in following it, we would be children of that truth. (…)<br /><br /><br />
Return to yourself a little, and no longer sleep in such a sleep; but wake up, taking advantage of this moment granted to you. Do not wait for time, for it does not wait. Truly know yourself, and know the great goodness of God toward you.<br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">3,21-30.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters, now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, though testified to by the law and the prophets,<br /><br />
the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction;<br /><br />
all have sinned and are deprived of the glory of God.<br /><br />
They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus,<br /><br />
whom God set forth as an expiation, through faith, by his blood, to prove his righteousness because of the forgiveness of sins previously committed,<br /><br />
through the forbearance of God--to prove his righteousness in the present time, that he might be righteous and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.<br /><br />
What occasion is there then for boasting? It is ruled out. On what principle, that of works? No, rather on the principle of faith.<br /><br />
For we consider that a person is justified by faith apart from works of the law.<br /><br />
Does God belong to Jews alone? Does he not belong to Gentiles, too? Yes, also to Gentiles,<br /><br />
for God is one and will justify the circumcised on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised through faith.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">130(129),1-2.3-4b.4c-6.</font>@@@@@Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD<br /><br />
LORD, hear my voice!<br /><br />
Let your ears be attentive<br /><br />
to my voice in supplication.
If you, O LORD, mark iniquities,<br /><br />
LORD, who can stand?<br /><br />
But with you is forgiveness,<br /><br />
that you may be revered.
I trust in the LORD;<br /><br />
my soul trusts in his word.<br /><br />
My soul waits for the Lord <br /><br />
more than sentinels for dawn.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">11,47-54.</font>@@@@@The Lord said: “Woe to you! You build the memorials of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.<br /><br />
Consequently, you bear witness and give consent to the deeds of your ancestors, for they killed them and you do the building.<br /><br />
Therefore, the wisdom of God said, &#039;I will send to them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and persecute&#039;<br /><br />
in order that this generation might be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world,<br /><br />
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who died between the altar and the temple building. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be charged with their blood!<br /><br />
Woe to you, scholars of the law! You have taken away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not enter and you stopped those trying to enter.&quot;<br /><br />
When he left, the scribes and Pharisees began to act with hostility toward him and to interrogate him about many things,<br /><br />
for they were plotting to catch him at something he might say.<br />
