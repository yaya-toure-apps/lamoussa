Our mandate is to “go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation” (Mk 16,15), for “the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God” (Rom 8,19). Here, “the creation” refers to every aspect of human life… The Church’s teachings concerning contingent situations are subject to new and further developments and can be open to discussion, yet we cannot help but be concrete… The Church’s pastors, taking into account the contributions of the different sciences, have the right to offer opinions on all that affects people’s lives, since the task of evangelization implies and demands the integral promotion of each human being. 
It is no longer possible to claim that religion should be restricted to the private sphere and that it exists only to prepare souls for heaven. We know that God wants his children to be happy in this world too, even though they are called to fulfilment in eternity, for he has created all things “for our enjoyment” (1 Tim 6,17), the enjoyment of everyone. It follows that Christian conversion demands reviewing especially those areas and aspects of life “related to the social order and the pursuit of the common good” (St John Paul II).
Consequently, no one can demand that religion should be relegated to the inner sanctum of personal life, without influence on societal and national life, without concern for the soundness of civil institutions, without a right to offer an opinion on events affecting society. Who would claim to lock up in a church and silence the message of Saint Francis of Assisi or Blessed Teresa of Calcutta? They themselves would have found this unacceptable. An authentic faith – which is never comfortable or completely personal – always involves a deep desire to change the world, to transmit values, to leave this earth somehow better that we found it. <br /><br />

Book of Ezra <font dir="ltr">9,5-9.</font>@@@@@At the time of the evening sacrifice, I, Ezra, rose in my wretchedness, and with cloak and mantle torn I fell on my knees, stretching out my hands to the LORD, my God.<br /><br />
I said: &quot;My God, I am too ashamed and confounded to raise my face to you, O my God, for our wicked deeds are heaped up above our heads and our guilt reaches up to heaven.<br /><br />
From the time of our fathers even to this day great has been our guilt, and for our wicked deeds we have been delivered over, we and our kings and our priests, to the will of the kings of foreign lands, to the sword, to captivity, to pillage, and to disgrace, as is the case today.<br /><br />
&quot;And now, but a short time ago, mercy came to us from the LORD, our God, who left us a remnant and gave us a stake in his holy place; thus our God has brightened our eyes and given us relief in our servitude.<br /><br />
For slaves we are, but in our servitude our God has not abandoned us; rather, he has turned the good will of the kings of Persia toward us. Thus he has given us new life to raise again the house of our God and restore its ruins, and has granted us a fence in Judah and Jerusalem.<br />

Book of Tobit <font dir="ltr">13,2.3-4a.4bcd.5.8.</font>@@@@@He scourges and then has mercy; <br /><br />
he casts down to the depths of the nether world, <br /><br />
and he brings up from the great abyss. <br /><br />
No one can escape his hand.
Praise him, you children of Israel, before the Gentiles, <br /><br />
for though he has scattered you among them,<br /><br />
He has shown you his greatness even there.
Exalt him before every living being,<br /><br />
because he is the Lord our God,<br /><br />
our Father and God forever.
He scourged you for your iniquities, <br /><br />
but will again have mercy on you all. <br /><br />
He will gather you from all the Gentiles among whom you have been scattered.<br /><br />
Celebrate days of gladness, and give him praise.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">9,1-6.</font>@@@@@Jesus summoned the Twelve and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases,<br /><br />
and he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.<br /><br />
He said to them, &quot;Take nothing for the journey, neither walking stick, nor sack, nor food, nor money, and let no one take a second tunic.<br /><br />
Whatever house you enter, stay there and leave from there.<br /><br />
And as for those who do not welcome you, when you leave that town, shake the dust from your feet in testimony against them.&quot;<br /><br />
Then they set out and went from village to village proclaiming the good news and curing diseases everywhere.<br />
