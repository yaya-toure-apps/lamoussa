<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Let them grow together until harvest"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
The Church has scandals, she has a reproach, she has a shame: no Catholic will deny it. She has ever had the reproach and shame of being the mother of children unworthy of her. She has good children;—she has many more bad... God might have formed a pure Church; but He has expressly predicted that the cockle, sown by the enemy, shall remain with the wheat, even to the harvest at the end of the world. He pronounced that His Church should be like a fisher&#039;s net, “gathering fish of every kind,” and not examined till the evening (Mt 13,47f.). Nay, more than this, He declared that the bad and imperfect should far surpass the good. &quot;Many are called,&quot; He said, &quot;but few are chosen&quot; (Mt 22,14); and His Apostle speaks of &quot;a remnant saved according to the election of grace&quot; (Rom 11,5). There is ever, then, an abundance of materials in the lives and the histories of Catholics ready to the use of her opponents... <br /><br />

But we do not bury our faces in our hands, we raise our hands and our faces to our Redeemer. &quot;As the eyes of servants are on the hands of their masters, and the eyes of the handmaid are on the hands of her mistress, so are our eyes unto the Lord our God, until He have mercy upon us” (Ps 123[122],2)... To Thee do we appeal, O true Judge, for Thou seest us. We care not for man while we have Thee..., while we have Thy presence in our assemblies, and Thy witness and Thy approval in our hearts.<br /><br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">24,3-8.</font>@@@@@When Moses came to the people and related all the words and ordinances of the LORD, they all answered with one voice, &quot;We will do everything that the LORD has told us.&quot;<br /><br />
Moses then wrote down all the words of the LORD and, rising early the next day, he erected at the foot of the mountain an altar and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.<br /><br />
Then, having sent certain young men of the Israelites to offer holocausts and sacrifice young bulls as peace offerings to the LORD,<br /><br />
Moses took half of the blood and put it in large bowls; the other half he splashed on the altar.<br /><br />
Taking the book of the covenant, he read it aloud to the people, who answered, &quot;All that the LORD has said, we will heed and do.&quot;<br /><br />
Then he took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, saying, &quot;This is the blood of the covenant which the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words of his.&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">50(49),1-2.5-6.14-15.</font>@@@@@God the LORD has spoken and summoned the earth, <br /><br />
from the rising of the sun to its setting.<br /><br />
From Zion, perfect in beauty, <br /><br />
God shines forth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
“Gather my faithful ones before me, <br /><br />
those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”<br /><br />
And the heavens proclaim his justice; <br /><br />
for God himself is the judge.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
“Offer to God praise as your sacrifice <br /><br />
and fulfill your vows to the Most High.<br /><br />
Then call upon me in time of distress; <br /><br />
I will rescue you, and you shall glorify me.”<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13,24-30.</font>@@@@@Jesus proposed a parable to the crowds. &quot;The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field.<br /><br />
While everyone was asleep his enemy came and sowed weeds all through the wheat, and then went off.<br /><br />
When the crop grew and bore fruit, the weeds appeared as well.<br /><br />
The slaves of the householder came to him and said, &#039;Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where have the weeds come from?&#039;<br /><br />
He answered, &#039;An enemy has done this.&#039; His slaves said to him, &#039;Do you want us to go and pull them up?&#039;<br /><br />
He replied, &#039;No, if you pull up the weeds you might uproot the wheat along with them.<br /><br />
Let them grow together until harvest; then at harvest time I will say to the harvesters, &quot;First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles for burning; but gather the wheat into my barn.&quot;&#039;&quot;<br />
