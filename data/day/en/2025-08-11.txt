The apostle Paul says that creation waits for the revealing of the sons of God (Rm 8:19). This creation  is now subjected to futility not by its own will but in hope, because it takes hope in Christ… Because creation will be liberated from the slavery of corruption to be taken up into the liberty of the sons of God, so that when the future glory is revealed there will be but one liberty for both creation and the sons of God. But now, in truth, whilst this revelation is in daily expectation, the whole creation groans as it awaits the glory of our adoption and redemption… <br /><br />
<br /><br />
The meaning is plain enough: they who have the first-fruits of the Spirit groan in expectation of their adoption as sons (v.9f). Now, that adoption is the redemption of a whole body. That will come about when he sees face to face, as an adopted son of God, the divine and eternal goodness. Even so is the adoption of sons in the Church of the Lord, when the Spirit cries out, “Abba! Father!” (v.15). But that redemption will be perfect when all who are graced to see the face of God rise again in incorruptibility, honour and glory. Then indeed human nature will judge that it is redeemed. That is why the Apostle Paul makes his boast when he says, “In this hope we are saved” (v.24). Hope saves, as also does faith, of which it is said: “Your faith has saved you” (Mk 5:34).<br />

Book of Deuteronomy <font dir="ltr">10,12-22.</font>@@@@@Moses said to the people: &quot;And now, Israel, what does the LORD, your God, ask of you but to fear the LORD, your God, and follow his ways exactly, to love and serve the LORD, your God, with all your heart and all your soul,<br /><br />
to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD which I enjoin on you today for your own good?<br /><br />
Think! The heavens, even the highest heavens, belong to the LORD, your God, as well as the earth and everything on it.<br /><br />
Yet in his love for your fathers the LORD was so attached to them as to choose you, their descendants, in preference to all other peoples, as indeed he has now done.<br /><br />
Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and be no longer stiff-necked.<br /><br />
For the LORD, your God, is the God of gods, the LORD of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who has no favorites, accepts no bribes;<br /><br />
who executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and befriends the alien, feeding and clothing him.<br /><br />
So you too must befriend the alien, for you were once aliens yourselves in the land of Egypt.<br /><br />
The LORD, your God, shall you fear, and him shall you serve; hold fast to him and swear by his name.<br /><br />
He is your glory, he, your God, who has done for you those great and terrible things which your own eyes have seen.<br /><br />
Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy strong, and now the LORD, your God, has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">147,12-13.14-15.19-20.</font>@@@@@Glorify the LORD, O Jerusalem; <br /><br />
praise your God, O Zion.<br /><br />
For he has strengthened the bars of your gates; <br /><br />
he has blessed your children within you.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He has granted peace in your borders; <br /><br />
with the best of wheat he fills you.<br /><br />
He sends forth his command to the earth; <br /><br />
swiftly runs his word!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He has proclaimed his word to Jacob, <br /><br />
his statutes and his ordinances to Israel.<br /><br />
He has not done thus for any other nation; <br /><br />
his ordinances he has not made known to them. Alleluia<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">17,22-27.</font>@@@@@As Jesus and his disciples were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, &quot;The Son of Man is to be handed over to men,<br /><br />
and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.&quot; And they were overwhelmed with grief.<br /><br />
When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and said, &quot;Doesn&#039;t your teacher pay the temple tax?&quot;<br /><br />
Yes, he said. When he came into the house, before he had time to speak, Jesus asked him, &quot;What is your opinion, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take tolls or census tax? From their subjects or from foreigners?&quot;<br /><br />
When he said, &quot;From foreigners,&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Then the subjects are exempt.<br /><br />
But that we may not offend them, go to the sea, drop in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. Open its mouth and you will find a coin worth twice the temple tax. Give that to them for me and for you.&quot;<br />
