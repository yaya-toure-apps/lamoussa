<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Lord I have distanced myself from you!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
I ran away, like the sheep,<br /><br />
Of your sensible herd;<br /><br />
I decreased the number of hundred<br /><br />
That you left in the high desert.<br /><br /><br />
You came out of love in search of the one;<br /><br />
Once found, you brought it on your shoulders to heaven;<br /><br />
You completed the number of the troop that had diminished,<br /><br />
To delight angels.<br /><br /><br />
You brought me too, Lord, with the multitude;<br /><br />
You have washed me from the mud and the sinking of sin;<br /><br />
In them again now I wallow,<br /><br />
Like the foolish friend of trash.<br /><br /><br />
Wash me again by means of tears;<br /><br />
Deign to give them to my unrepentant soul<br /><br />
Like an abundant and bubbling stream,<br /><br />
Like the overflowing fountain.<br /><br /><br />
And I who have been intentionally lost,<br /><br />
Make me come back to your divine will;<br /><br />
The will of my  first free will<br /><br />
Remove that which doesn&#039;t obey you.<br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">14,7-12.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: None of us lives for oneself, and no one dies for oneself.<br /><br />
For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord; so then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord&#039;s.<br /><br />
For this is why Christ died and came to life, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.<br /><br />
Why then do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you look down on your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God;<br /><br />
for it is written: &quot;As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bend before me, and every tongue shall give praise to God.&quot;<br /><br />
So (then) each of us shall give an account of himself (to God).<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">27(26),1.4.13-14.</font>@@@@@The LORD is my light and my salvation; <br /><br />
whom should I fear? <br /><br />
The LORD is my life&#039;s refuge; <br /><br />
of whom should I be afraid?
One thing I ask of the LORD <br /><br />
this I seek: <br /><br />
to dwell in the house of the LORD <br /><br />
all the days of my life, <br /><br />
that I may gaze on the loveliness of the LORD <br /><br />
and contemplate his temple.  
I believe that I shall see the bounty of the LORD <br /><br />
in the land of the living.<br /><br />
Wait for the LORD with courage; <br /><br />
be stouthearted, and wait for the LORD.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">15,1-10.</font>@@@@@Tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to Jesus,<br /><br />
but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying, &quot;This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.&quot;<br /><br />
So to them he addressed this parable.<br /><br />
&quot;What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds it?<br /><br />
And when he does find it, he sets it on his shoulders with great joy<br /><br />
and, upon his arrival home, he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them, &#039;Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.&#039;<br /><br />
I tell you, in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.&quot;<br /><br />
Or what woman having ten coins and losing one would not light a lamp and sweep the house, searching carefully until she finds it?<br /><br />
And when she does find it, she calls together her friends and neighbors and says to them, &#039;Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I lost.&#039;<br /><br />
In just the same way, I tell you, there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&quot;<br />
