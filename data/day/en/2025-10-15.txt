A brother who had sinned was turned out of the church by the priest ; Abba Bessarion got up and went with him, saying : « I too am a sinner »…<br /><br /><br />
A brother at Scetis committed a fault. A council was called to which Abba Moses was invited, but he refused to go to it. Then the priest sent someone to say to him: “Come, for everyone is waiting for you.” So he got up and went along with a basket that had holes in it, which he filled with sand and carried on his back. The others came out to meet him and said to him: “What is this, Father?” The old man said to them: “My sins run out behind me and I do not see them, and today I am coming to judge the sins of another.” When they heard that they said no more to the brother but forgave him.<br /><br /><br />
Abba Joseph questioned Abba Poemen saying: “Tell me how to become a monk.” The old man said: “If you want to find peace here below and in the world to come, say at all times: Who am I? And judge no one.”<br /><br /><br />
A brother questioned Abba Poemen saying: “If I see my brother committing a sin, is it right to conceal it?” The old man said to him: “At the very moment when we hide our brother’s fault, God hides our own. And at the moment we reveal our brother’s fault, God reveals ours too.”<br /><br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">2,1-11.</font>@@@@@You, O man, are without excuse, every one of you who passes judgment. For by the standard by which you judge another you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the very same things.<br /><br />
We know that the judgment of God on those who do such things is true.<br /><br />
Do you suppose, then, you who judge those who engage in such things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?<br /><br />
Or do you hold his priceless kindness, forbearance, and patience in low esteem, unaware that the kindness of God would lead you to repentance?<br /><br />
By your stubbornness and impenitent heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself for the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment of God,<br /><br />
who will repay everyone according to his works:<br /><br />
eternal life to those who seek glory, honor, and immortality through perseverance in good works,<br /><br />
but wrath and fury to those who selfishly disobey the truth and obey wickedness.<br /><br />
Yes, affliction and distress will come upon every human being who does evil, Jew first and then Greek.<br /><br />
But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, Jew first and then Greek.<br /><br />
There is no partiality with God.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">62(61),2-3.6-7.9.</font>@@@@@Only in God is my soul at rest;<br /><br />
from him comes my salvation.<br /><br />
He only is my rock and my salvation,<br /><br />
my stronghold; I shall not be disturbed at all.
Only in God be at rest, my soul,<br /><br />
for from him comes my hope.<br /><br />
He only is my rock and my salvation,<br /><br />
my stronghold; I shall not be disturbed.
Trust in him at all times, O my people!<br /><br />
Pour out your hearts before him;<br /><br />
God is our refuge!<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">11,42-46.</font>@@@@@The Lord said: &quot;Woe to you Pharisees! You pay tithes of mint and of rue and of every garden herb, but you pay no attention to judgment and to love for God. These you should have done, without overlooking the others.<br /><br />
Woe to you Pharisees! You love the seat of honor in synagogues and greetings in marketplaces.<br /><br />
Woe to you! You are like unseen graves over which people unknowingly walk.&quot;<br /><br />
Then one of the scholars of the law said to him in reply, &quot;Teacher, by saying this you are insulting us too.&quot;<br /><br />
And he said, &quot;Woe also to you scholars of the law! You impose on people burdens hard to carry, but you yourselves do not lift one finger to touch them.&quot;<br />
