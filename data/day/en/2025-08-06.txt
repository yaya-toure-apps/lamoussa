<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Among those standing here there are some who will not taste death before they have seen the Kingdom of God"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Our Lord Jesus Christ took Peter, James and John onto the mountain to show them the glory of his divinity and teach them to know he was the Redeemer of Israel, as he had demonstrated through the prophets. He wanted to prevent them being scandalized, also, by the sight of his freely accepted sufferings, which he would suffer for us in his human nature. For they knew him as man but were ignorant that he was God; they knew him as Maryâ€™s son, a man dwelling in the world with them, but on the mountain he showed them he was Son of God and God himself.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
They had seen him eat and drink, work and rest, grow weary and sleep, undergo fear even to great drops of sweat: all things that seemed to bear no relation to his divine nature and seemed to belong only to his humanity. This was why he took them onto the mountain, so that the Father might call him his Son and show them that he was truly his Son and that he was God. He took them onto the mountain and showed them his Kingdom before making known his sufferings, his power before his death, his glory before his maltreatment, and his honor before his shame. Thus, when he was taken and crucified, his apostles would know that it had not been through weakness but by consent and of his own free will, for the salvation of the world.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">97(96),1-2.5-6.9.</font>@@@@@The LORD is king; let the earth rejoice; <br /><br />
let the many islands be glad.<br /><br />
Clouds and darkness are round about him, <br /><br />
justice and judgment are the foundation of his throne.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, <br /><br />
before the Lord of all the earth.<br /><br />
The heavens proclaim his justice, <br /><br />
and all peoples see his glory.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
You, O LORD, are the Most High over all the earth, <br /><br />
exalted far above all gods.<br />

@@@@@Beloved: We did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty.<br /><br />
For he received honor and glory from God the Father when that unique declaration came to him from the majestic glory, &quot;This is my Son, my beloved, with whom I am well pleased.&quot;<br /><br />
We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain.<br /><br />
Moreover, we possess the prophetic message that is altogether reliable. You will do well to be attentive to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.<br />
