<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Enlighten me with the light of the Most Holy Faith!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
O abyss! Eternal Deity! Bottomless ocean! Couldst Thou have given me more than to give Thyself to me? Thou art the fire that ever burns and is never extinguished. Thou art the fire that consumes the self-love of the soul. Thou art the fire that melts all ice. Thou art illumination. In Thy flame I have known the truth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Thou art that light above all light which supernaturally enlightens the eye of the intellect, with such abundance and perfection that Thou makest clear the light of faith; in this faith I see that my soul has life, and in this light I receive Thee, O Light. Through the light of faith I possess wisdom in the Wisdom of the Word; through the light of faith I am strong, constant, and persevering; through the light of faith I hope and do not falter along the way. This light teaches me the true path; without it, I would walk in darkness. Therefore I beseech Thee, Eternal Father, to enlighten me with the light of the Most Holy Faith. (...)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O Eternal Trinity, in the light that Thou hast given me with the Most Holy Faith, I have known the way of great perfection. Thou hast shown it to me that I may serve Thee in light and not in darkness, that I may be a mirror of good and holy life and may at last tear myself away from the wretched existence which I lead, through my own fault, in the shadows. (…) Clothe me, O Eternal Truth, clothe me with Thyself, that my mortal life may flow in true obedience and in the light of the Most Holy Faith, with which Thou hast inebriated my soul.<br />

Book of Wisdom <font dir="ltr">1:1-7.</font>@@@@@Love justice, you who rule the earth; think rightly of the Lord, and seek Him with a sincere heart,<br /><br />
for He is found by those who do not put Him to the test, and He reveals Himself to those who do not distrust Him.<br /><br />
Crooked thoughts separate from God, and His power convicts the foolish who test Him.<br /><br />
For Wisdom will not enter into a soul that plots evil, nor dwell in a body enslaved to sin.<br /><br />
For the Holy Spirit, the teacher of mankind, flees deceit and withdraws from senseless designs; when injustice appears, it is confounded.<br /><br />
Wisdom is a spirit that loves humanity, but she will not leave the blasphemer unpunished for his words; for God searches the depths of the heart, perceives the soul in all clarity, and listens to every utterance of the lips.<br /><br />
The Spirit of the Lord fills the universe, and He, who holds all things together, hears every voice.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">139(138):1-2.5a.3-4.7-8.9-10.</font>@@@@@You search me, Lord, and You know me!<br /><br />
You know when I sit and when I rise;<br /><br />
from afar You discern my thoughts.<br /><br />
You go before me and follow me;<br /><br />
You have laid Your hand upon me.<br /><br />
Whether I walk or rest, You see me;<br /><br />
all my ways are known to You.<br /><br />
Before a word is on my tongue,<br /><br />
You, Lord, know it completely.<br /><br />
Where can I go from Your Spirit?<br /><br />
Where can I flee from Your presence?<br /><br />
If I ascend to the heavens, You are there;<br /><br />
if I lie down in Sheol, there You are.<br /><br />
If I take the wings of the dawn<br /><br />
and dwell at the farthest sea,<br /><br />
even there Your hand shall guide me,<br /><br />
Your right hand shall hold me fast.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">17:1-6.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: “It is inevitable that scandals and stumbling blocks should come; but woe to the one through whom they come!<br /><br />
It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.<br /><br />
Be on your guard! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.<br /><br />
And if seven times a day he sins against you, and seven times returns to you saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”<br /><br />
The Apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”<br /><br />
The Lord replied, “If you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.”<br />
