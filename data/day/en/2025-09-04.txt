Peter threw himself humbly at Jesus&#039; feet. Recognising his Lord in him, he said: “Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man and am not worthy to stay with you. Depart from me, for I am only a man and you are the God-man; I am sinful and you are holy; I am a servant, you the Master. Let distance separate you from me who am distanced from you by the weakness of my nature, the ugliness of my sins and the weakness of my strength...”<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      	But the Lord comforted Peter by showing him the catch of fish that showed how he would become a fisher of men. “Do not be afraid,” he said to him, “Do not be frightened but believe and rejoice. For you are destined for an even greater catch; another kind of boat and another kind of net will be given you. Hitherto you have caught fish with your nets but from now on you will catch men with your words. The word of God is like a fisherman&#039;s bait. Just as the hook does not catch the fish until it has been taken by it, so the word of God does not capture a man for eternal life unless this word has first of all entered his thoughts. From now on it is men you will catch. &#039;From now on&#039;: that is to say, after all that has taken place, after the proof of your humility, you will be responsible for catching men. For humility has the force of attraction and it is good to know how not to boast in one&#039;s own power if one is to have authority over others.<br /><br />

Letter to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">1,9-14.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: from the day we heard about you, we do not cease praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding<br /><br />
to live in a manner worthy of the Lord, so as to be fully pleasing, in every good work bearing fruit and growing in the knowledge of God,<br /><br />
strengthened with every power, in accord with his glorious might, for all endurance and patience, with joy<br /><br />
giving thanks to the Father, who has made you fit to share in the inheritance of the holy ones in light.<br /><br />
He delivered us from the power of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,<br /><br />
in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">98(97),2-3ab.3cd-4.5-6.</font>@@@@@The LORD has made his salvation known: <br /><br />
in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice.<br /><br />
He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness<br /><br />
toward the house of Israel.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All the ends of the earth have seen<br /><br />
the salvation by our God.<br /><br />
Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands; <br /><br />
break into song; sing praise.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Sing praise to the LORD with the harp, <br /><br />
with the harp and melodious song.<br /><br />
With trumpets and the sound of the horn <br /><br />
sing joyfully before the King, the LORD.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">5,1-11.</font>@@@@@While the crowd was pressing in on Jesus and listening to the word of God, he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.<br /><br />
He saw two boats there alongside the lake; the fishermen had disembarked and were washing their nets.<br /><br />
Getting into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, he asked him to put out a short distance from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.<br /><br />
After he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, &quot;Put out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch.&quot;<br /><br />
Simon said in reply, &quot;Master, we have worked hard all night and have caught nothing, but at your command I will lower the nets.&quot;<br /><br />
When they had done this, they caught a great number of fish and their nets were tearing.<br /><br />
They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come to help them. They came and filled both boats so that they were in danger of sinking.<br /><br />
When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at the knees of Jesus and said, &quot;Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.&quot;<br /><br />
For astonishment at the catch of fish they had made seized him and all those with him,<br /><br />
and likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners of Simon. Jesus said to Simon, &quot;Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.&quot;<br /><br />
When they brought their boats to the shore, they left everything and followed him.<br />
