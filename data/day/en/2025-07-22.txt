But now bear with my foolishness for a little. I confess, then, though I say it in my foolishness, that the Word has visited me, and even very often. But although He has frequently entered into my soul, I have never at any time been sen sible of the precise moment of His coming. I have felt that He was present. I remember that He has been with me; I have sometimes been able even to have a presentiment that He would come; but never to feel His coming, nor His departure. For whence He came<br /><br />
to enter my soul, or whither He went on quitting it, by what means He has made entrance or departure, I confess that I know not even to this day ; according to that which is said: Thou canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth (John iii. 8). <br /><br />
<br /><br />
&#039;It is not by the eyes that He enters, for He is without form or colour that they can discern ,&#039; nor by the ears, for His coming is without sound;  nor, lastly, is it capable of being traced by the touch, for it is intangible. By what avenue, then, has He entered? Or per haps the fact may be that He has not entered at all, nor indeed come at all from outside. For not one of these things belongs to outside. Yet it has not come from within me, for it is good, and I know that in me dwelleth no good thing (Rom. vii. 18).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 I have ascended higher than myself, and lo! I have found the Word above me still...thus I have learned the truth of the words I had read: In bfim we live and move and have our being (Acts xvii. 28) ; but blessed is the man in whom He is, who lives for Him, and is moved by Him.<br /><br />

Song of Songs <font dir="ltr">3,1-4a.</font>@@@@@The bride says: On my bed at night I sought him whom my heart loves - I sought him but I did not find him.<br /><br />
I will rise then and go about the city; in the streets and crossings I will seek Him whom my heart loves. I sought him but I did not find him.<br /><br />
The watchmen came upon me as they made their rounds of the city: Have you seen him whom my heart loves?<br /><br />
I had hardly left them when I found him whom my heart loves.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John <font dir="ltr">20,1-2.11-18.</font>@@@@@On the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning, while it was still dark, and saw the stone removed from the tomb.<br /><br />
So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them, &quot;They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don&#039;t know where they put him.&quot;<br /><br />
But Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent over into the tomb<br /><br />
and saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been.<br /><br />
And they said to her, &quot;Woman, why are you weeping?&quot; She said to them, &quot;They have taken my Lord, and I don&#039;t know where they laid him.&quot;<br /><br />
When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus there, but did not know it was Jesus.<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, &quot;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&quot; She thought it was the gardener and said to him, &quot;Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you laid him, and I will take him.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, &quot;Mary!&quot; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &quot;Rabbouni,&quot; which means Teacher.<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, &quot;Stop holding on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, &#039;I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />
Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples, &quot;I have seen the Lord,&quot; and what he told her.<br />
