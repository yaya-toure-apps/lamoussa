<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Consider the original equality of the human family</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
But men, if they have gold or silver and soft and precious garments and shining gems and such things beyond their need, things that are the cause of war and strife and of the very beginning of tyranny, they bury them in the ground and, above themselves with folly, close their hearts to pity for the needs of their fellow men. Not even from what is superfluous will they help those in total want. Oh the immense folly! the fearful madness of it! <br /><br />
<br /><br />
They never think, if nothing else, that riches and poverty, slavery and what we call freedom, and such terms, came among men with sin, as weaknesses that rushed in together with wickedness, and were its invention. From the beginning, says the Lord, it was not so (Mt. xix. 8). He Who created man at the beginning, created him free, endowed him with free will, ruled by the sole law of His commandment, and rich in the joy of paradise. And He willed the same for the rest of the race of men,<br /><br />
bestowing it on them through that first seed. Freedom then, and wealth, lay simply in the observance of His single commandment: True slavery and poverty in its transgression.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
From this came hatred and strife and the deceits of the serpent tyrant, tempting us at all times with the bait of unlawful pleasures, setting the strong against the weak; and from then our race was divided, and greed defeated the nobility of our nature, making use even of law as an aid to its domination.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
But I would have you look back to our original equality, not to the later division; not to the law of the strongest, but to the law of the Creator. Help nature with all your might. Reverence the ancient freedom. Reverence yourself. Cover the shame of your own kindred. Help the afflicted. Comfort those in sorrow. You who are strong, help the weak. You who are rich, help the poor... Be as God to the unfortunate, by imitating the mercy of God.<br /><br />

Book of Ecclesiastes <font dir="ltr">1,2.2,21-23.</font>@@@@@Vanity of vanities, says Qoheleth, vanity of vanities! All things are vanity!<br /><br />
For here is a man who has labored with wisdom and knowledge and skill, and to another, who has not labored over it, he must leave his property. This also is vanity and a great misfortune.<br /><br />
For what profit comes to a man from all the toil and anxiety of heart with which he has labored under the sun?<br /><br />
All his days sorrow and grief are his occupation; even at night his mind is not at rest. This also is vanity.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">90(89),3-4.5-6.12-13.14.17.</font>@@@@@You turn man back to dust, <br /><br />
saying, &quot;Return, O children of men.&quot;<br /><br />
For a thousand years in your sight <br /><br />
are as yesterday, now that it is past, <br /><br />
or as a watch of the night.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
You make an end of them in their sleep; <br /><br />
the next morning they are like the changing grass,<br /><br />
Which at dawn springs up anew, <br /><br />
but by evening wilts and fades.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Teach us to number our days aright, <br /><br />
that we may gain wisdom of heart.<br /><br />
Return, O LORD! How long? <br /><br />
Have pity on your servants!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Fill us at daybreak with your kindness, <br /><br />
that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days.<br /><br />
And may the gracious care of the LORD our God be ours; <br /><br />
Prosper the work of our hands for us! <br /><br />
Prosper the work of our hands!<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">12,13-21.</font>@@@@@Someone in the crowd said to Jesus, &quot;Teacher, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me.&quot;<br /><br />
He replied to him, &quot;Friend, who appointed me as your judge and arbitrator?&quot;<br /><br />
Then he said to the crowd, &quot;Take care to guard against all greed, for though one may be rich, one&#039;s life does not consist of possessions.&quot;<br /><br />
Then he told them a parable. &quot;There was a rich man whose land produced a bountiful harvest.<br /><br />
He asked himself, &#039;What shall I do, for I do not have space to store my harvest?&#039;<br /><br />
And he said, &#039;This is what I shall do: I shall tear down my barns and build larger ones. There I shall store all my grain and other goods<br /><br />
and I shall say to myself, &quot;Now as for you, you have so many good things stored up for many years, rest, eat, drink, be merry!&quot;<br /><br />
But God said to him, &#039;You fool, this night your life will be demanded of you; and the things you have prepared, to whom will they belong?&#039;<br /><br />
Thus will it be for the one who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich in what matters to God.&quot;<br />

Letter to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">3,1-5.9-11.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters:  If you were raised with Christ, seek what is above,  where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.<br /><br />
Think of what is above, not of what is on earth.<br /><br />
For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.<br /><br />
When Christ your life appears, then you too will appear with him in glory.<br /><br />
Put to death, then, the parts of you that are earthly: immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and the greed that is idolatry.<br /><br />
Stop lying to one another, since you have taken off the old self with its practices<br /><br />
and have put on the new self, which is being renewed, for knowledge, in the image of its creator.<br /><br />
Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all and in all.<br />
