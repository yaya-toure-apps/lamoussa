<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The strong soul is well armed</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
O my dearest Son, we see that God has armed man with such a strong weapon that neither the devil nor creatures can harm him. It is man&#039;s free will, and it is because of this freedom that God said: &quot;I created you without you, but I will not save you without you.&quot;<br /><br /><br />
God therefore wants us to use the weapons he has given and to resist the blows we receive from our enemies. We have three principal enemies: the world, the flesh, and the devil. But let us not fear; divine Providence has armed us so well that we need fear nothing. The armor is good, and the One who helps us is even better: He is God, whom nothing can resist, and as long as the soul looks to this gentle and powerful Helper, it cannot fall into any weakness. This seems to have been the thought of the ardent Saint Paul when he said: &quot;I can do all things through Jesus crucified, who is in me and strengthens me&quot; (cf. Phil 4:13).<br /><br /><br />
When Paul felt the attacks and the sting of the flesh, he was strengthened not by himself, whom he saw as weak, but by Christ Jesus and by the good armor that God had given him, granting him freedom. He said: &quot;I can do all things, and neither the devil nor creatures can force me to commit mortal sin if I do not want to.&quot; As long as man does not strip himself of these weapons and place them in the hands of the devil by the consent of his will, he is never defeated, even though the devil, the flesh, and the world come to attack him and hurl their poisoned arrows at him (â€¦).<br /><br /><br />
I do not want you, my dear son in Christ Jesus, to fear anything in this trial.<br />

Book of Joel <font dir="ltr">1,13-15.2,1-2.</font>@@@@@Gird yourselves and weep, O priests! wail, O ministers of the altar! Come, spend the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God! The house of your God is deprived of offering and libation.<br /><br />
Proclaim a fast, call an assembly; Gather the elders, all who dwell in the land, Into the house of the LORD, your God, and cry to the LORD!<br /><br />
Alas, the day! for near is the day of the LORD, and it comes as ruin from the Almighty.<br /><br />
Blow the trumpet in Zion, sound the alarm on my holy mountain! Let all who dwell in the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming;<br /><br />
Yes, it is near, a day of darkness and of gloom, a day of clouds and somberness! Like dawn spreading over the mountains, a people numerous and mighty! Their like has not been from of old, nor will it be after them, even to the years of distant generations.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">9(9A),2-3.6.16.8-9.</font>@@@@@I will give thanks to you, LORD, with all my heart; <br /><br />
I will declare all your wondrous deeds.<br /><br />
I will delight and exult in your name; <br /><br />
I will sing hymns to your name, Most High.
You rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked;<br /><br />
their name you blotted out forever and ever.<br /><br />
The nations are sunk in the pit they have made;<br /><br />
in the snare they set, their foot is caught.
But the LORD sits enthroned forever;<br /><br />
he has set up his throne for judgment.<br /><br />
He judges the world with justice;<br /><br />
he governs the peoples with equity.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">11,15-26.</font>@@@@@When Jesus had driven out a demon, some of the crowd said: &quot;By the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he drives out demons.&quot;<br /><br />
Others, to test him, asked him for a sign from heaven.<br /><br />
But he knew their thoughts and said to them, &quot;Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste and house will fall against house.<br /><br />
And if Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that it is by Beelzebul that I drive out demons.<br /><br />
If I, then, drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own people drive them out? Therefore they will be your judges.<br /><br />
But if it is by the finger of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.<br /><br />
When a strong man fully armed guards his palace, his possessions are safe.<br /><br />
But when one stronger than he attacks and overcomes him, he takes away the armor on which he relied and distributes the spoils.<br /><br />
Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.&quot;<br /><br />
When an unclean spirit goes out of someone, it roams through arid regions searching for rest but, finding none, it says, &#039;I shall return to my home from which I came.&#039;<br /><br />
But upon returning, it finds it swept clean and put in order.<br /><br />
Then it goes and brings back seven other spirits more wicked than itself who move in and dwell there, and the last condition of that person is worse than the first.&quot;<br />
