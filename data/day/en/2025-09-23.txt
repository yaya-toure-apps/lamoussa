      Despite the real organic unity of the head and the body, the Church stands beside Christ as an independent person. As the Son of the eternal Father, Christ lived before the beginning of time and before all human existence. Then, by the act of creation, humanity lived before Christ had taken its nature and united himself to it. But by his Incarnation, he brought it his divine life&nbsp;; by his work of redemption, he made it capable of receiving grace so that he recreated it a second time... The Church is redeemed humanity, newly created from the very substance of Christ. <br /><br />
<br />

      The primitive cell of this redeemed humanity is Mary&nbsp;; it is in her that for the first time purification and sanctification by Christ took place, she was the first to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Before the Son of God was born of the Holy Virgin, he created this Virgin full of grace and, in her and with her, the Church...<br /><br />
<br />

      Every soul purified by baptism and raised to the state of grace is thereby created by Christ and born for Christ. But it is created in the Church and it is born through the Church... Thus the Church is the mother of all those to whom redemption is addressed. She is so by her intimate union with Christ, and because she stands at his side as the Bride of Christ to collaborate in his work of redemption.<br />

Book of Ezra <font dir="ltr">6,7-8.12b.14-20.</font>@@@@@In those days, King Darius of Persia wrote to the authorities of the province west of the Euphrates: Let the governor of Judah and the elders of the Jews work on this House of God: they must rebuild it on its site.<br /><br />
Here are my orders concerning your conduct toward the elders of the Jews for the reconstruction of this House of God: the expenses of these people shall be reimbursed to them, exactly and without interruption, from the royal funds, that is to say from the tax of the province.<br /><br />
I, Darius, have given this order. Let it be strictly carried out!<br /><br />
The elders of the Jews continued successfully the work of construction, encouraged by the word of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo. They completed the construction in accordance with the command of the God of Israel, according to the decrees of Cyrus and of Darius.<br /><br />
The House of God was completed on the third day of the month called Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius.<br /><br />
The sons of Israel, the priests, the Levites and the rest of the returnees joyfully celebrated the dedication of this House of God.<br /><br />
For this dedication they sacrificed one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs and, as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.<br /><br />
Then they appointed the priests according to their classes, and the Levites according to their groups, for the service of God in Jerusalem, according to the prescriptions of the book of Moses.<br /><br />
The returnees celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.<br /><br />
All the priests and all the Levites, without exception, had purified themselves: all were pure. So they sacrificed the Passover for all the returnees, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">122(121),1-2.3-4a.4b-5.</font>@@@@@What joy when they said to me: <br /><br />

“We will go to the house of the Lord!”<br /><br />
Now our journey comes to an end <br /><br />

standing at your gates, Jerusalem!<br /><br />
Jerusalem, here you are within your walls: <br /><br />

city where everything is united as one!<br /><br />
There go up the tribes,<br /><br />
the tribes of the Lord.<br /><br />
There is the seat of judgment, <br /><br />

the seat of the house of David.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">8,19-21.</font>@@@@@At that time, the mother and brothers of Jesus came to see him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.<br /><br />
It was told to him: “Your mother and your brothers are outside, who want to see you.”<br /><br />
He answered them: “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and put it into practice.”<br />
