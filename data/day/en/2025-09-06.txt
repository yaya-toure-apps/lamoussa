<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">« The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath »</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      Each day of creation is great, admirable, but none can be compared to the seventh&nbsp;: for then it is not the creation of one or another natural element that is set before our contemplation, but God’s own rest and the perfection of all creatures. For we read&nbsp;: «&nbsp;On the seventh day, God completed the work he had done, and he rested from all the work he had created&nbsp;» (Gn 2:2). Great is this day, unfathomable this rest, magnificent this Sabbath&nbsp;! Ah, if only you could understand&nbsp;! This day is not traced by the course of the visible sun, it does not begin at its rising, nor end at its setting&nbsp;; it has neither morning nor evening (cf. Gn 1:5)...<br /><br />
<br />
      Let us listen to the one who invites us to rest&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened&nbsp;; I will give you rest&nbsp;» (Mt 11:28). This is the preparation for the Sabbath. As for the Sabbath itself, let us listen again&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart&nbsp;; and you will find rest&nbsp;» (v. 29). Behold rest, tranquility, behold the true Sabbath....<br /><br />
<br />
      For this yoke is not heavy, it unites&nbsp;; this burden has wings, not weight. This yoke is charity&nbsp;; this burden is fraternal love. There is where rest is found&nbsp;; there, the Sabbath is celebrated&nbsp;; there, one is freed from all servile work... Even if some sin slips in, because of our weakness, the celebration of this Sabbath is not interrupted, for «&nbsp;charity covers a multitude of sins&nbsp;» (1 Pt 4:8). It is therefore fitting that this liberation be reserved for the seventh day for «&nbsp;the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us&nbsp;» (Rom 5:5).<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">1:21-23.</font>@@@@@Brothers, you were once alienated from God, even enemies in mind and in evil deeds.<br /><br />
But now God has reconciled you to himself, through the body of Christ, his fleshly body, through his death, to present you holy, without blemish, and irreproachable before him.<br /><br />
This will come true if you remain firmly grounded in faith, without turning aside from the hope you received when you heard the Gospel proclaimed to every creature under heaven. Of this Gospel I, Paul, have become a minister.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">54(53):3-4,6,8.</font>@@@@@By your name, O God, save me, <br /><br />
by your power do me justice;<br /><br />
O God, hear my prayer, <br /><br />
listen to the words of my mouth.<br /><br /><br />
But behold, God is my helper,<br /><br />
the Lord sustains my life.<br /><br />
With a willing heart, I will sacrifice to you, <br /><br />
I will give thanks to your name, for it is good!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">6:1-5.</font>@@@@@One Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grainfields; his disciples were picking heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.<br /><br />
Some Pharisees said: « Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath? »<br /><br />
Jesus answered them: « Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?<br /><br />
He entered the house of God, took the bread of offering, ate it and gave some to his companions, although only the priests are permitted to eat it. »<br /><br />
And he said to them: « The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. »<br />
