<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Whoever humbles himself will be exalted"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
He who recognizes his own sins… is greater than he who raises the dead through his prayer. He who weeps over the state of his soul for an hour is greater than he who embraces the world in contemplation. He to whom it has been given to see the truth about himself is greater than he to whom it has been given to see angels.<br /><br />

Book of Ruth <font dir="ltr">2,1-3.8-11.4,13-17.</font>@@@@@Naomi had a well-known relative named Boaz, of the family of her husband Elimelech.<br /><br />
Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi: "Let me go and glean ears of grain in the field of anyone who will show me favor." Naomi said to her: "Go, my daughter,"<br /><br />
and she went. The field where she entered to glean behind the reapers happened to belong to Boaz, of the family of Elimelech.<br /><br />
Boaz said to Ruth: "Listen, my daughter! Do not go to glean in another field; do not leave here. Stay here with my servant girls.<br /><br />
Watch carefully which field they are harvesting, and follow them; I have ordered the young men not to harm you. When you are thirsty, you may go and drink from the vessels the young men have filled."<br /><br />
Falling face to the ground, she said to him: "Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should notice me, a foreigner?"<br /><br />
Boaz answered her: "I have been told in detail what you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband: you left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and you came to a people you did not know before.<br /><br />
Boaz took Ruth. When they were united as husband and wife, the LORD allowed her to conceive, and she bore a son.<br /><br />
Then the women said to Naomi: "Blessed be the LORD, who today has not left you without an heir! May his name become famous in Israel!<br /><br />
He will be for you a comfort and the support of your old age, for his mother is your daughter-in-law who loves you. She is better for you than seven sons!"<br /><br />
Naomi took the child, placed him on her lap, and became his nurse.<br /><br />
And the neighbors gave him a name, saying that a son had been born to Naomi. They called him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">128(127),1-2.3.4.5.</font>@@@@@Happy are you if you fear the LORD, <br /><br />
if you walk in his ways!<br /><br />
You shall enjoy the fruit of your labor; <br /><br />
happy shall you be, and favored with blessings.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine <br /><br />
in the heart of your house; <br /><br />
Your sons like olive shoots <br /><br />
around your table.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Thus is the man blessed <br /><br />
who fears the LORD.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
May the LORD bless you from Zion: <br /><br />
may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem <br /><br />
all the days of your life.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">23,1-12.</font>@@@@@Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,<br /><br />
saying: "The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their seat on the chair of Moses.<br /><br />
So do and observe whatever they tell you, but do not follow their example. For they preach but do not practice.<br /><br />
They tie up heavy burdens, hard to carry, and lay them on people’s shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with their finger.<br /><br />
All their works they do to be seen by others. They widen their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels.<br /><br />
They love places of honor at banquets, the best seats in the synagogues,<br /><br />
greetings in the marketplaces, and being called ‘Rabbi’.<br /><br />
But you, do not be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one teacher, and you are all brothers.<br /><br />
Call no one on earth your father, for you have only one Father, the one in heaven.<br /><br />
Do not be called ‘Master,’ for you have only one master, the Christ.<br /><br />
The greatest among you will be your servant.<br /><br />
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled; but whoever humbles himself will be exalted."<br />
