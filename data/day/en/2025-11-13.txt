<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"The kingdom of God is among you."</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
        The demons dread but God and his angels desire one who fervently seeks God day and night in his heart and repels the enemy&#039;s attacks. The spiritual country of one who is pure in soul lies within himself: the sun that shines within him is the light of the Holy Trinity; the air breathed through the thoughts within him is the holy Spirit, the Comforter; and the holy angels abide with him. Their life, their joy, their gladness is Christ, light of the Father&#039;s light. Such a one continually enjoys the contemplation of his soul, marvelling at the beauty he sees there, shining a hundred times more powerfully than the brightness of the sun.<br /><br /><br />
	This is Jerusalem. And it is “the Kingdom of God within us”, to use the Lord&#039;s own words. This country is the cloud of God&#039;s glory into which only the pure of heart can enter to behold their Master&#039;s face (Mt 5,8). Their minds will be enlightened by the rays of his light.<br />

Book of Wisdom <font dir="ltr">7,22-30.8,1.</font>@@@@@In Wisdom is a spirit intelligent, holy, unique, Manifold, subtle, agile, clear, unstained, certain, Not baneful, loving the good, keen, unhampered, beneficent,<br /><br />
kindly, Firm, secure, tranquil, all-powerful, all-seeing, And pervading all spirits, though they be intelligent, pure and very subtle.<br /><br />
For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion, and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity.<br /><br />
For she is an aura of the might of God and a pure effusion of the glory of the Almighty; therefore nought that is sullied enters into her.<br /><br />
For she is the refulgence of eternal light, the spotless mirror of the power of God, the image of his goodness.<br /><br />
And she, who is one, can do all things, and renews everything while herself perduring; And passing into holy souls from age to age, she produces friends of God and prophets.<br /><br />
For there is nought God loves, be it not one who dwells with Wisdom.<br /><br />
For she is fairer than the sun and surpasses every constellation of the stars. Compared to light, she takes precedence;<br /><br />
for that, indeed, night supplants, but wickedness prevails not over Wisdom.<br /><br />
Indeed, she reaches from end to end mightily and governs all things well.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">119(118),89.90.91.130.135.175.</font>@@@@@Your word, O LORD, endures forever; <br /><br />
it is firm as the heavens.<br /><br />
Through all generations your truth endures;<br /><br />
you have established the earth, and it stands firm.
According to your ordinances they still stand firm: <br /><br />
all things serve you.<br /><br />
The revelation of your words sheds light,<br /><br />
giving understanding to the simple.
Let your countenance shine upon your servant,<br /><br />
and teach me your statutes.<br /><br />
Let my soul live to praise you, <br /><br />
and may your ordinances help me.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">17,20-25.</font>@@@@@Asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, Jesus said in reply, “The coming of the Kingdom of God cannot be observed,<br /><br />
and no one will announce, &#039;Look, here it is,&#039; or, &#039;There it is.&#039; For behold, the kingdom of God is among you.&quot;<br /><br />
Then he said to his disciples, &quot;The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.<br /><br />
There will be those who will say to you, &#039;Look, there he is,&#039; (or) &#039;Look, here he is.&#039; Do not go off, do not run in pursuit.<br /><br />
For just as lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be (in his day).<br /><br />
But first he must suffer greatly and be rejected by this generation.&quot;<br />
