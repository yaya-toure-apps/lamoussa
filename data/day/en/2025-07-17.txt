<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Come to me!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
“You were all invited, generally and in particular, by My Truth, when He cried in the Temple, saying: ’Whosoever thirsts, let him come to Me and drink, for I am the Fountain of the Water of Life.’ He did not say ’Go to the Father and drink,’ but He said ’Come to Me.’ <br /><br />
<br /><br />
He spoke thus, because in Me, the Father, there can be no pain, but in My Son there can be pain. And you, while you are pilgrims and wayfarers in this mortal life, cannot be without pain, because the earth, through sin, brought forth thorns. And why did He say ’Let him come to Me and drink’? Because whoever follows His doctrine, whether in the most perfect way or by dwelling in the life of common charity, finds to drink, tasting the fruit of the<br /><br />
Blood, through the union of the Divine nature with the human nature. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
And you, finding yourselves in Him, find yourselves also in Me, who am the Sea Pacific, because I am one thing with Him, and He with Me. So that you are invited to the Fountain of Living Water of Grace.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">3,13-20.</font>@@@@@Moses, hearing the voice of the LORD from the burning bush, said to him, “When I go to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ if they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what am I to tell them?”<br /><br />
God replied, &quot;I am who am.&quot; Then he added, &quot;This is what you shall tell the Israelites: I AM sent me to you.&quot;<br /><br />
God spoke further to Moses, &quot;Thus shall you say to the Israelites: The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. &quot;This is my name forever; this is my title for all generations.<br /><br />
&quot;Go and assemble the elders of the Israelites, and tell them: The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to me and said: I am concerned about you and about the way you are being treated in Egypt;<br /><br />
so I have decided to lead you up out of the misery of Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.<br /><br />
&quot;Thus they will heed your message. Then you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him: The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent us word. Permit us, then, to go a three days&#039; journey in the desert, that we may offer sacrifice to the LORD, our God.<br /><br />
&quot;Yet I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go unless he is forced.<br /><br />
I will stretch out my hand, therefore, and smite Egypt by doing all kinds of wondrous deeds there. After that he will send you away.&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">105(104),1.5.8-9.24-25.26-27.</font>@@@@@Give thanks to the LORD, invoke his name; <br /><br />
make known among the nations his deeds.<br /><br />
Recall the wondrous deeds that he has wrought, <br /><br />
his portents, and the judgments he has uttered.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He remembers forever his covenant <br /><br />
which he made binding for a thousand generations.<br /><br />
Which he entered into with Abraham <br /><br />
and by his oath to Isaac.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He greatly increased his people <br /><br />
and made them stronger than their foes,<br /><br />
Whose hearts he changed, so that they hated his people, <br /><br />
and dealt deceitfully with his servants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He sent Moses his servant; <br /><br />
Aaron, whom he had chosen.<br /><br />
They wrought his signs among them,  <br /><br />
and wonders in the land of Ham.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">11,28-30.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to the crowds: “Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.<br /><br />
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for yourselves.<br /><br />
For my yoke is easy, and my burden light.&quot;<br />
