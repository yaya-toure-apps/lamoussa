	The origins of Scripture are not to be found through human research but in the divine revelation coming from the “Father of lights”, “from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named” (Jas 1,17; Eph 3,15). From him, through his Son Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit is poured out on us. Faith has been given to us through the Holy Spirit, sharing and distributing his gifts to each of us according to his will (Heb 2,4), and “through faith Christ dwells in our hearts” (Eph 3,17). From this knowledge of Jesus Christ flows, as from its source, both strength and understanding of the whole of holy Scripture. It is impossible, therefore, to enter into a knowledge of Scripture without first of all possessing an infused faith in Christ as the light, doorway and foundation of all Scripture…
	The end, or fruit, of holy Scripture is not without purpose; it is the fullness of life eternal. For in Scripture are to be found “the words of eternal life” (Jn 6,68). It has been written, therefore, not only that we might believe in but that we might also possess the eternal life in which we shall see and love and our desires will be wholly satisfied. Then, when our desires have been satisfied, we shall truly know “the love that surpasses knowledge” and so we shall be “filled with all the fullness of God” (Eph 3,19). It is to this fullness that Scripture tries to introduce us and so it is to this end, with this intention, that Scripture ought to be studied, taught and understood.<br /><br />

First Letter to Timothy <font dir="ltr">6,13-16.</font>@@@@@Beloved: I charge (you) before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate for the noble confession,<br /><br />
to keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ<br /><br />
that the blessed and only ruler will make manifest at the proper time, the King of kings and Lord of lords,<br /><br />
who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, and whom no human being has seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal power. Amen.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">100(99),2.3.4.5.</font>@@@@@Sing joyfully to the Lord all you lands,<br /><br />
serve the LORD with gladness; <br /><br />
come before him with joyful song.
Know that the LORD is God; <br /><br />
he made us, his we are; <br /><br />
his people, the flock he tends.
Enter his gates with thanksgiving, <br /><br />
his courts with praise; <br /><br />
give thanks to him; bless his name. 
The LORD is good: <br /><br />
his kindness endures forever, <br /><br />
and his faithfulness, to all generations.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">8,4-15.</font>@@@@@When a large crowd gathered, with people from one town after another journeying to Jesus, he spoke in a parable.<br /><br />
A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path and was trampled, and the birds of the sky ate it up.<br /><br />
Some seed fell on rocky ground, and when it grew, it withered for lack of moisture.<br /><br />
Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it.<br /><br />
And some seed fell on good soil, and when it grew, it produced fruit a hundredfold.&quot; After saying this, he called out, &quot;Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear.&quot;<br /><br />
Then his disciples asked him what the meaning of this parable might be.<br /><br />
He answered, &quot;Knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been granted to you; but to the rest, they are made known through parables so that &#039;they may look but not see, and hear but not understand.&#039;<br /><br />
This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.<br /><br />
Those on the path are the ones who have heard, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts that they may not believe and be saved.<br /><br />
Those on rocky ground are the ones who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, but they have no root; they believe only for a time and fall away in time of trial.<br /><br />
As for the seed that fell among thorns, they are the ones who have heard, but as they go along, they are choked by the anxieties and riches and pleasures of life, and they fail to produce mature fruit.<br /><br />
But as for the seed that fell on rich soil, they are the ones who, when they have heard the word, embrace it with a generous and good heart, and bear fruit through perseverance.&quot;<br />
