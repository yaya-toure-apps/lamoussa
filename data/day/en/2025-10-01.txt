<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"The Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Remember the Father&#039;s glory, <br /><br />
Remember the divine splendor <br /><br />
You left in exiling yourself on earth <br /><br />
To redeem all the poor sinners.<br /><br />
O Jesus! Humbling yourself to the Virgin Mary, <br /><br />
You veiled your infinite greatness and glory.<br /><br />
Ah! Your mother&#039;s breast<br /><br />
Was your second heaven, <br /><br />
Rememberâ€¦<br /><br /><br />
Remember that on other shores <br /><br />
The golden stars and silver moon <br /><br />
On which I gaze in the cloudless sky <br /><br />
Delighted and charmed your Infant eyes.<br /><br />
With your little hand that caressed Mary <br /><br />
You upheld the world and gave it life,<br /><br />
And you thought of me,<br /><br />
Jesus, my little King, <br /><br />
Remember.<br /><br /><br />
Remember that you worked in solitude <br /><br />
With your divine hands.<br /><br />
To live forgotten was your sweetest task.<br /><br />
You rejected human learning.<br /><br />
O You who with just one word could charm the world,<br /><br />
You took delight in hiding your profound wisdom.<br /><br />
You seemed unlearned,<br /><br />
O All-powerful Lord!<br /><br />
Remember.<br /><br /><br />
Remember that you wandered as a Stranger on earth. <br /><br />
You, the Eternal Word, <br /><br />
You had nothing, no, not even a stone, <br /><br />
Not a shelter, like the birds of heaven.<br /><br />
O Jesus! come within me, come rest your Head, <br /><br />
Come, my soul is truly ready to receive you. <br /><br />
My Beloved Savior, <br /><br />
Rest in my heart. <br /><br />
It is Yours.<br /><br />

Book of Nehemiah <font dir="ltr">2,1-8.</font>@@@@@In the month Nisan of the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when the wine was in my charge, I took some and offered it to the king. As I had never before been sad in his presence,<br /><br />
the king asked me, &quot;Why do you look sad? If you are not sick, you must be sad at heart.&quot; Though I was seized with great fear,<br /><br />
I answered the king: &quot;May the king live forever! How could I not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been eaten out by fire?&quot;<br /><br />
The king asked me, &quot;What is it, then, that you wish?&quot; I prayed to the God of heaven<br /><br />
and then answered the king: &quot;If it please the king, and if your servant is deserving of your favor, send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors&#039; graves, to rebuild it.&quot;<br /><br />
Then the king, and the queen seated beside him, asked me how long my journey would take and when I would return. I set a date that was acceptable to him, and the king agreed that I might go.<br /><br />
I asked the king further: &quot;If it please the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of West-of-Euphrates, that they may afford me safe-conduct till I arrive in Judah;<br /><br />
also a letter for Asaph, the keeper of the royal park, that he may give me wood for timbering the gates of the temple-citadel and for the city wall and the house that I shall occupy.&quot; The king granted my requests, for the favoring hand of my God was upon me.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">137(136),1-2.3.4-5.6.</font>@@@@@By the rivers of Babylon <br /><br />
we sat mourning and weeping <br /><br />
when we remembered Zion.<br /><br />
On the poplars of that land <br /><br />
we hung up our harps.
There our captors asked us <br /><br />
for the words of a song; <br /><br />
Our tormentors, for a joyful song: <br /><br />
&quot;Sing for us a song of Zion!&quot;
But how could we sing a song of the LORD <br /><br />
in a foreign land?<br /><br />
If I forget you, Jerusalem, <br /><br />
may my right hand wither.
May my tongue stick to my palate <br /><br />
if I do not remember you, <br /><br />
if I do not exalt Jerusalem <br /><br />
beyond all my delights.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">9,57-62.</font>@@@@@As Jesus and His disciples were proceeding on their journey someone said to him, &quot;I will follow you wherever you go.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus answered him, &quot;Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head.&quot;<br /><br />
And to another he said, &quot;Follow me.&quot; But he replied, &quot;Lord, let me go first and bury my father.&quot;<br /><br />
But he answered him, &quot;Let the dead bury their dead. But you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.&quot;<br /><br />
And another said, &quot;I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say farewell to my family at home.&quot;<br /><br />
Jesus answered him, &quot;No one who sets a hand to the plow and looks to what was left behind is fit for the kingdom of God.&quot;<br />
