<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Useless servants"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
The proper way of serving others leads to humility. The one who serves does not consider himself superior to the one served, however miserable his situation at the moment may be. Christ took the lowest place in the world—the Cross—and by this radical humility he redeemed us and constantly comes to our aid. Those who are in a position to help others will realize that in doing so they themselves receive help; being able to help others is no merit or achievement of their own. This duty is a grace. <br /><br /><br />
The more we do for others, the more we understand and can appropriate the words of Christ: “We are useless servants” (Lk 17:10). We recognize that we are not acting on the basis of any superiority or greater personal efficiency, but because the Lord has graciously enabled us to do so. There are times when the burden of need and our own limitations might tempt us to become discouraged. But precisely then we are helped by the knowledge that, in the end, we are only instruments in the Lord&#039;s hands; and this knowledge frees us from the presumption of thinking that we alone are personally responsible for building a better world. In all humility we will do what we can, and in all humility we will entrust the rest to the Lord. <br /><br /><br />
It is God who governs the world, not we. We offer him our service only to the extent that we can, and for as long as he grants us the strength. To do all we can with what strength we have, however, is the task which keeps the good servant of Jesus Christ always at work: “The love of Christ urges us on” (2 Cor 5:14).<br />

Book of Habakkuk <font dir="ltr">1,2-3.2,2-4.</font>@@@@@How long, O LORD? I cry for help but you do not listen! I cry out to you, &quot;Violence!&quot; but you do not intervene.<br /><br />
Why do you let me see ruin; why must I look at misery? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and clamorous discord.<br /><br />
Then the LORD answered me and said: Write down the vision Clearly upon the tablets, so that one can read it readily.<br /><br />
For the vision still has its time, presses on to fulfillment, and will not disappoint; If it delays, wait for it, it will surely come, it will not be late.<br /><br />
The rash man has no integrity; but the just man, because of his faith, shall live.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">95(94),1-2.6-7.8-9.</font>@@@@@Come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD; <br /><br />
let us acclaim the Rock of our salvation.<br /><br />
Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; <br /><br />
let us joyfully sing psalms to him.
Come, let us bow down in worship; <br /><br />
let us kneel before the LORD who made us.<br /><br />
For he is our God, <br /><br />
and we are the people he shepherds, the flock he guides.
Oh, that today you would hear his voice:<br /><br />
“Harden not your hearts as at Meribah, <br /><br />
as in the day of Massah in the desert,<br /><br />
Where your fathers tempted me; <br /><br />
they tested me though they had seen my works.”  <br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">17,5-10.</font>@@@@@The apostles said to the Lord, &quot;Increase our faith.&quot;<br /><br />
The Lord replied, &quot;If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you would say to (this) mulberry tree, &#039;Be uprooted and planted in the sea,&#039; and it would obey you.<br /><br />
Who among you would say to your servant who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field, &#039;Come here immediately and take your place at table&#039;?<br /><br />
Would he not rather say to him, &#039;Prepare something for me to eat. Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink. You may eat and drink when I am finished&#039;?<br /><br />
Is he grateful to that servant because he did what was commanded?<br /><br />
So should it be with you. When you have done all you have been commanded, say, &#039;We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we were obliged to do.&#039;&quot;<br />

Second Letter to Timothy <font dir="ltr">1,6-8.13-14.</font>@@@@@Beloved: I remind you to stir into flame the gift of God that you have through the imposition of my hands.<br /><br />
For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather of power and love and self-control.<br /><br />
So do not be ashamed of your testimony to our Lord, nor of me, a prisoner for his sake; but bear your share of hardship for the gospel with the strength that comes from God.<br /><br />
Take as your norm the sound words that you heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.<br /><br />
Guard this rich trust with the help of the holy Spirit that dwells within us.<br />
