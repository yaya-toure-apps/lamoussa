<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Lord hear our prayers!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
we will ask, with instancy of prayer and supplication, that the Creator of the universe may guard intact unto the end the number that hath been numbered of His elect throughout the whole world, through His beloved Son Jesus Christ, through whom He called us from darkness to light, from ignorance to the full knowledge of the glory of His Name.  [Grant unto us, Lord,] that we may set our hope on Thy Name which is the primal source of all creation.<br /><br /><br />
Thou through Thine operations didst make manifest the everlasting fabric of the world. Thou, Lord, didst create the earth. Thou that art faithful throughout all generations, righteous in Thy judgments, marvelous in strength and excellence, Thou that art wise in creating and prudent in establishing that which Thou hast made, that art good in the things which are seen and faithful with them that trust on Thee, pitiful and compassionate.<br /><br /><br />
Forgive us our iniquities and our unrighteousnesses and our transgressions and shortcomings.  Lay not to our account every sin of Thy servants and Thine handmaids,<br /><br />
but cleanse us with the cleansing of Thy truth, and guide our steps to walk in holiness and righteousness and singleness of heart and to do such things as are good<br /><br />
and well pleasing in Thy sight and in the sight of our rulers.<br /><br /><br />
 Yea, Lord, make Thy face to shine upon us in peace for our good, that we may be sheltered by Thy mighty hand and delivered from every sin by Thine uplifted arm. And deliver us from them that hate us wrongfully.  Give concord and peace to us and to all that dwell on the earth, as Thou gavest to our fathers, when they called on Thee in faith and truth with holiness.<br />

Book of Wisdom <font dir="ltr">18,14-16.19,6-9.</font>@@@@@When peaceful stillness compassed everything and the night in its swift course was half spent,<br /><br />
Your all-powerful word from heaven&#039;s royal throne bounded, a fierce warrior, into the doomed land,<br /><br />
bearing the sharp sword of your inexorable decree. And as he alighted, he filled every place with death; he still reached to heaven, while he stood upon the earth.<br /><br />
For all creation, in its several kinds, was being made over anew, serving its natural laws, that your children might be preserved unharmed.<br /><br />
The cloud overshadowed their camp; and out of what had before been water, dry land was seen emerging: Out of the Red Sea an unimpeded road, and a grassy plain out of the mighty flood.<br /><br />
Over this crossed the whole nation sheltered by your hand, after they beheld stupendous wonders.<br /><br />
For they ranged about like horses, and bounded about like lambs, praising you, O LORD! their deliverer.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">105(104),2-3.36-37.42-43.</font>@@@@@Sing to him, sing his praise, <br /><br />
proclaim all his wondrous deeds.<br /><br />
Glory in his holy name; <br /><br />
rejoice, O hearts that seek the LORD!
He struck down every firstborn in the land, <br /><br />
the first fruits of all their manhood.<br /><br />
And he led them forth laden with silver and gold,<br /><br />
with not a weakling among their tribes.
For he remembered his holy word<br /><br />
to his servant Abraham.<br /><br />
And he led forth his people with joy;<br /><br />
with shouts of joy, his chosen ones.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">18,1-8.</font>@@@@@Jesus told his disciples a parable about the necessity for them to pray always without becoming weary. He said,<br /><br />
&quot;There was a judge in a certain town who neither feared God nor respected any human being.<br /><br />
And a widow in that town used to come to him and say, &#039;Render a just decision for me against my adversary.&#039;<br /><br />
For a long time the judge was unwilling, but eventually he thought, &#039;While it is true that I neither fear God nor respect any human being,<br /><br />
because this widow keeps bothering me I shall deliver a just decision for her lest she finally come and strike me.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />
The Lord said, &quot;Pay attention to what the dishonest judge says.<br /><br />
Will not God then secure the rights of his chosen ones who call out to him day and night? Will he be slow to answer them?<br /><br />
I tell you, he will see to it that justice is done for them speedily. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?&quot;<br />
