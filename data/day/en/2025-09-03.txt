The apostle Paul writes : « I was mercifully treated so that in me, as the foremost, Christ Jesus might display all his patience as an example for those who would come to believe in him for everlasting life » (1Tim 1,16). Desiring to show pardon to all, he chose one of his most vicious enemies so that, when they saw him healed, no one would be tempted to despair.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Isn’t this just what doctors do? When they have settled somewhere where they are not yet known they first of all single out people who are suffering from incurable illnesses so as to give proof of their kindness and make their skill known. Then each will say to the other: “Go and seek out this particular doctor; I assure you that he made me well again!... I had the same illness as you; I went through the same suffering.” This is what Paul said to each sick person in danger of despairing: “The one who healed me sends me to you, saying: Go and look for that hopeless sick person, tell him of your illness, make known to him the pain from which I cured you… Shout aloud to the despairing: ‘This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners’ (1Tim 1,15). What have you to fear? Why tremble? I myself am ‘the foremost of sinners’. I’m telling this to you, I who have been cured to you who are sick ; I who now stand upright to you who are cast down ; I who today am full of confidence to you who despair. »<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So don’t let yourself go to pieces. Are you sick? Come to him and you will be healed. Are you blind? Come to him and you will be enlightened… Let everyone say: “Come, let us bow and bend low before him; let us weep before the Lord who made us” (Ps 94[95],6 Vg).<br /><br />

Letter to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">1,1-8.</font>@@@@@Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,<br /><br />
to the holy ones and faithful brothers in Christ in Colossae: grace to you and peace from God our Father.<br /><br />
We always give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,<br /><br />
for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for all the holy ones<br /><br />
because of the hope reserved for you in heaven. Of this you have already heard through the word of truth, the gospel,<br /><br />
that has come to you. Just as in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing, so also among you, from the day you heard it and came to know the grace of God in truth,<br /><br />
as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow slave, who is a trustworthy minister of Christ on your behalf<br /><br />
and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.<br />

and proclaim the goodness of your name <br /><br />
before your faithful ones.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">4,38-44.</font>@@@@@After Jesus left the synagogue, he entered the house of Simon. Simon&#039;s mother-in-law was afflicted with a severe fever, and they interceded with him about her.<br /><br />
He stood over her, rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up immediately and waited on them.<br /><br />
At sunset, all who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him. He laid his hands on each of them and cured them.<br /><br />
And demons also came out from many, shouting, &quot;You are the Son of God.&quot; But he rebuked them and did not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Messiah.<br /><br />
At daybreak, Jesus left and went to a deserted place. The crowds went looking for him, and when they came to him, they tried to prevent him from leaving them.<br /><br />
But he said to them, &quot;To the other towns also I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this purpose I have been sent.&quot;<br /><br />
And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.<br />
