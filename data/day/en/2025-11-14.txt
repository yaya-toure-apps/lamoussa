<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"As it was in the days of Noah"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Noah, the wise... went into the ark at God&#039;s orders together with his sons and their wives, a mere eight souls in all. With constant groans this servant prayed thus: “Let me not perish with sinners, my Savior, for already I see chaos swamping creation and the elements shaken with fear... The clouds are ready, the sky stormy, angels run before your wrath.” At these words, God shut the ark and sealed it as his faithful one cried out: “Save mankind from wrath, O redeemer of the world, may you protect us with your love.”
Then, from the heights of heaven, the judge gives the order: immediately the floodgates open, pouring down rain and hail in torrents from one end of the world to the other; fear causes the springs of the abyss to gush forth, flooding the earth in every quarter... Such were the results of God&#039;s anger because humankind had persisted in its hardness of heart instead of hastening to cry out to him with faith: “Save all humankind from wrath in the love you have for us, O Redeemer of the world”...
Then the choir of angels cried out, seeing carnal men destroyed: “Now let the just possess the length and breadth of the earth!” For the Creator delights to behold those made in his own image (Gn 1,26); this is why he set aside his saints to save them. Noah... released the dove and in the evening it returned, bearing an olive branch in its beak, symbolically announcing God&#039;s mercy. Then Noah came out of the ark as from the tomb, according to the command he had received..., not, as formerly, like Adam, who had eaten of the tree that brings death, for Noah had brought forth the fruits of repentance, saying: “Save all humankind from wrath in the love you have for us, O Redeemer of the world.”
Corruption and wickedness have perished; the man of upright heart is victorious by his faith for he has found grace... Then the just man (Gn 6,9) offers an unblemished sacrifice to the Lord... The Creator, smelling the sweet-smelling odor, declares: “Nevermore will the world perish in a flood, even should all men lead a life of wickedness.  Today I will make with them a binding covenant. I will show my bow as a sign to all the dwellers on earth, that thus they may call upon my name: “Save all humankind from wrath in the love you have for us, O Redeemer of the world.”<br /><br />

Book of Wisdom <font dir="ltr">13,1-9.</font>@@@@@All men were by nature foolish who were in ignorance of God, and who from the good things seen did not succeed in knowing him who is, and from studying the works did not discern the artisan;<br /><br />
But either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or the circuit of the stars, or the mighty water, or the luminaries of heaven, the governors of the world, they considered gods.<br /><br />
Now if out of joy in their beauty they thought them gods, let them know how far more excellent is the Lord than these; for the original source of beauty fashioned them.<br /><br />
Or if they were struck by their might and energy, let them from these things realize how much more powerful is he who made them.<br /><br />
For from the greatness and the beauty of created things their original author, by analogy, is seen.<br /><br />
But yet, for these the blame is less; For they indeed have gone astray perhaps, though they seek God and wish to find him.<br /><br />
For they search busily among his works, but are distracted by what they see, because the things seen are fair.<br /><br />
But again, not even these are pardonable.<br /><br />
For if they so far succeeded in knowledge that they could speculate about the world, how did they not more quickly find its LORD?<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">19(18),2-3.4-5.</font>@@@@@The heavens declare the glory of God; <br /><br />
and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.<br /><br />
Day pours out the word to day, <br /><br />
and night to night imparts knowledge.
Not a word nor a discourse <br /><br />
whose voice is not heard;<br /><br />
Through all the earth their voice resounds, <br /><br />
and to the ends of the world, their message.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">17,26-37.</font>@@@@@Jesus said to his disciples: “As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man;<br /><br />
they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage up to the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.<br /><br />
Similarly, as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building;<br /><br />
on the day when Lot left Sodom, fire and brimstone rained from the sky to destroy them all.<br /><br />
So it will be on the day the Son of Man is revealed.<br /><br />
On that day, a person who is on the housetop and whose belongings are in the house must not go down to get them, and likewise a person in the field must not return to what was left behind.<br /><br />
Remember the wife of Lot.<br /><br />
Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses it will save it.<br /><br />
I tell you, on that night there will be two people in one bed; one will be taken, the other left.<br /><br />
And there will be two women grinding meal together; one will be taken, the other left.&quot;
They said to him in reply, &quot;Where, Lord?&quot; He said to them, &quot;Where the body is, there also the vultures will gather.&quot;<br />
