<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The meaning of the Sabbath</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
The sabbath - the end of the work of the six days: <br /><br />
The sacred text says that &quot;on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done&quot;, that the &quot;heavens and the earth were finished&quot;, and that God &quot;rested&quot; on this day and sanctified and blessed it (Gn 2,13). These inspired words are rich in profitable instruction.<br /><br /><br />
In creation God laid a foundation and established laws that remain firm, on which the believer can rely with confidence, for they are the sign and pledge of the unshakeable faithfulness of God&#039;s covenant. For his part man must remain faithful to this foundation, and respect the laws which the Creator has written into it.<br /><br /><br />
Creation was fashioned with a view to the sabbath and therefore for the worship and adoration of God. Worship is inscribed in the order of creation. As the rule of St. Benedict says, nothing should take precedence over &quot;the work of God&quot;, that is, solemn worship. This indicates the right order of human concerns.<br /><br />
The sabbath is at the heart of Israel&#039;s law. To keep the commandments is to correspond to the wisdom and the will of God as expressed in his work of creation.<br /><br />
The eighth day. But for us a new day has dawned: the day of Christ&#039;s Resurrection. The seventh day completes the first creation. The eighth day begins the new creation. Thus, the work of creation culminates in the greater work of redemption. The first creation finds its meaning and its summit in the new creation in Christ, the splendour of which surpasses that of the first creation. <br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">9,1-5.</font>@@@@@Brothers and Sisters: I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie; my conscience joins with the holy Spirit in bearing me witness<br /><br />
that I have great sorrow and constant anguish in my heart.<br /><br />
For I could wish that I myself were accursed and separated from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kin according to the flesh.<br /><br />
They are Israelites; theirs the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises;<br /><br />
theirs the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, is the Messiah. God who is over all be blessed forever. Amen.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">147,12-13.14-15.19-20.</font>@@@@@Glorify the LORD, O Jerusalem; <br /><br />
praise your God, O Zion.<br /><br />
For he has strengthened the bars of your gates; <br /><br />
he has blessed your children within you.
He has granted peace in your borders; <br /><br />
with the best of wheat he fills you.<br /><br />
He sends forth his command to the earth; <br /><br />
swiftly runs his word!
He has proclaimed his word to Jacob, <br /><br />
his statutes and his ordinances to Israel.<br /><br />
He has not done thus for any other nation; <br /><br />
his ordinances he has not made known to them. Alleluia<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">14,1-6.</font>@@@@@On a sabbath Jesus went to dine at the home of one of the leading Pharisees, and the people there were observing him carefully.<br /><br />
In front of him there was a man suffering from dropsy.<br /><br />
Jesus spoke to the scholars of the law and Pharisees in reply, asking, &quot;Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath or not?&quot;<br /><br />
But they kept silent; so he took the man and, after he had healed him, dismissed him.<br /><br />
Then he said to them, &quot;Who among you, if your son or ox falls into a cistern, would not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day?&quot;<br /><br />
But they were unable to answer his question.<br />
