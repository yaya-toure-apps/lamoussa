<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Practice gentleness!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            [Our Lord&amp;nbsp;:] «&amp;nbsp;Another virtue that I have often recommended to you by My words and even more often by My example is gentleness&amp;nbsp;: it is for you, for the good of you all, that I have so often preached it to you… Practice this gentleness in your thoughts, keeping away, casting out as inspirations of the devil every thought of bitterness, harshness, rigidity, violence, anger, resentment, antipathy, severe judgments about those over whom you have no charge&amp;nbsp;; welcome and nurture gentle, tender, charitable thoughts, thoughts of sympathy, kindness, gratitude…<br /><br />
<br />
            Be moved as you contemplate the love you owe to all men, My beloved children, your brothers&amp;nbsp;; the gratitude you owe to all, who all do you some good through the communion of saints, through the glory that all, willingly or unwillingly, give to Me, your Beloved. In all men you have tender and very powerful friends, since you continually have, along with them, their good angels.<br /><br />
<br />
            Be all honey, all tenderness, all peace in your thoughts… And be the same in your words…, if sometimes, by duty, you are obliged to have severe words, let even your severity show, as through a transparent veil that covers a foundation of eternal gentleness, that it is only temporary, that it will cease as soon as the very good of the souls to whom it is addressed no longer requires it, that it desires only to vanish and give way to gentleness.&amp;nbsp;»<br />

Book of Zechariah <font dir="ltr">8,20-23.</font>@@@@@Thus says the Lord of hosts: See, once again peoples will flow in, inhabitants of many cities.<br /><br />
The inhabitants of one city will go to another and say: “Let us go to entreat the face of the Lord, let us go to seek the Lord of hosts! As for me, I am going.”<br /><br />
Many peoples and mighty nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the Lord of hosts and to entreat his face.<br /><br />
Thus says the Lord of hosts: In those days, ten men from every language and every nation will seize a Jew by his garment and say: “We want to go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">87(86),1-3.4-5.6-7.</font>@@@@@Its foundation is on the holy mountains.<br /><br />
The Lord loves the gates of Zion <br /><br />
more than all the dwellings of Jacob.<br /><br />
Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God!<br />
“I count Egypt and Babylon <br /><br />
among those who know me.” <br /><br />
See Philistia, Tyre, Ethiopia: <br /><br />
each one was born there.<br /><br />
But of Zion it shall be said: “Mother!” <br /><br />
for in her everyone was born. <br /><br />
<br />
It is He, the Most High, who establishes her.<br /><br />
In the register of peoples, the Lord writes: <br /><br />
“Each one was born there.”<br /><br />
All together they dance, and they sing: <br /><br />
<br />
“In you are all our springs!”<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to St Luke <font dir="ltr">9,51-56.</font>@@@@@As the time was approaching when he was to be taken up to heaven, Jesus, with steadfast face, set out for Jerusalem.<br /><br />
He sent messengers ahead of him; they went and entered a Samaritan village to prepare for his arrival.<br /><br />
But they did not welcome him, because he was going to Jerusalem.<br /><br />
When the disciples James and John saw this, they said: “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them?”<br /><br />
But Jesus turned and rebuked them.<br /><br />
Then they went on to another village.<br />
