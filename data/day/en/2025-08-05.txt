<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Take courage! Do not be afraid</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
‘My children, whatever happens to you, remember that I am always with you; remember whether you perceive me or not, whether I seem to be active or sleeping, forgetful of you, I am always watching and am always all-powerful. Never be afraid, never be anxious: I am there. I watch, I love. You never doubt my love, I hope. I am <br /><br />
all-powerful. What more do you ask? <br /><br />
<br /><br />
All that happens to you is by my permission and will, by my loving will, that you may draw good out of it, good that I myself, through my grace, help you to derive from it. Therefore, fear nothing, since nothing can happen to you that is not permitted by me. Be not troubled (unless it be by instinctive feelings that involuntarily rush over you, prompted by nature and the senses) but unite your will with mine. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Remember how many storms I have quieted by a word, making a great calm to follow. Remember how I held up Peter walking on the waters. I am always as near to all men as I was then to him, and as ready to help and succour in all that is for the good of the soul. Be confident, faithful, courageous ; have no fear for your body and soul, for I am there, loving and all-powerful... In this life the tempest never ceases, and your boat is ever ready to sink. But I am there, and with me it will never be wrecked. Trust nothing, yourself least of all; but in me have that &#039;perfect confidence that banishes fear.’ <br />

Book of Numbers <font dir="ltr">12,1-13.</font>@@@@@Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses on the pretext of the marriage he had contracted with a Cushite woman.<br /><br />
They complained, &quot;Is it through Moses alone that the LORD speaks? Does he not speak through us also?&quot; And the LORD heard this.<br /><br />
Now, Moses himself was by far the meekest man on the face of the earth.<br /><br />
So at once the LORD said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam, &quot;Come out, you three, to the meeting tent.&quot; And the three of them went.<br /><br />
Then the LORD came down in the column of cloud, and standing at the entrance of the tent, called Aaron and Miriam. When both came forward,<br /><br />
he said, &quot;Now listen to the words of the LORD: Should there be a prophet among you, in visions will I reveal myself to him, in dreams will I speak to him;<br /><br />
Not so with my servant Moses! Throughout my house he bears my trust:<br /><br />
face to face I speak to him, plainly and not in riddles. The presence of the LORD he beholds. Why, then, did you not fear to speak against my servant Moses?&quot;<br /><br />
So angry was the LORD against them that when he departed,<br /><br />
and the cloud withdrew from the tent, there was Miriam, a snow-white leper! When Aaron turned and saw her a leper,<br /><br />
&quot;Ah, my lord!&quot; he said to Moses, &quot;please do not charge us with the sin that we have foolishly committed!<br /><br />
Let her not thus be like the stillborn babe that comes forth from its mother&#039;s womb with its flesh half consumed.&quot;<br /><br />
Then Moses cried to the LORD, &quot;Please, not this! Pray, heal her!&quot;<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">51(50),3-4.5-6a.6bc-7.12-13.</font>@@@@@Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; <br /><br />
in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense.<br /><br />
Thoroughly wash me from my guilt <br /><br />
and of my sin cleanse me.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For I acknowledge my offense, <br /><br />
and my sin is before me always:<br /><br />
&quot;Against you only have I sinned,<br /><br />
and done what is evil in your sight.&quot;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
That you may be justified in your sentence,<br /><br />
vindicated when you condemn.<br /><br />
Indeed, in guilt was I born,<br /><br />
and in sin my mother conceived me.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A clean heart create for me, O God, <br /><br />
and a steadfast spirit renew within me.<br /><br />
Cast me not out from your presence, <br /><br />
and your Holy Spirit take not from me.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">14,22-36.</font>@@@@@After he had fed the people, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and precede him to the other side of the sea, while he dismissed the crowds.<br /><br />
After doing so, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When it was evening he was there alone.<br /><br />
Meanwhile the boat, already a few miles offshore, was being tossed about by the waves, for the wind was against it.<br /><br />
During the fourth watch of the night, he came toward them, walking on the sea.<br /><br />
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified. &quot;It is a ghost,&quot; they said, and they cried out in fear.<br /><br />
At once (Jesus) spoke to them, &quot;Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.&quot;<br /><br />
Peter said to him in reply, &quot;Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.&quot;<br /><br />
He said, &quot;Come.&quot; Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on the water toward Jesus.<br /><br />
But when he saw how (strong) the wind was he became frightened; and, beginning to sink, he cried out, &quot;Lord, save me!&quot;<br /><br />
Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him, and said to him, &quot;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&quot;<br /><br />
After they got into the boat, the wind died down.<br /><br />
Those who were in the boat did him homage, saying, &quot;Truly, you are the Son of God.&quot;<br /><br />
After making the crossing, they came to land at Gennesaret.<br /><br />
When the men of that place recognized him, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought to him all those who were sick<br /><br />
and begged him that they might touch only the tassel on his cloak, and as many as touched it were healed.<br />
