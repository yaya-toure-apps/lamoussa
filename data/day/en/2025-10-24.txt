<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Knowing how to read the signs of our time</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
We give you thanks, 
faithful and tender Father, 
for having given us Jesus your Son, 
our Lord and our brother. 
His love was shown 
to the poor and the sick, to the little ones and to sinners. 
He was not indifferent to any distress. 
His life and his message are for us the proof 
that you are a God who cares for men, 
as a father takes care of his children. 
That is why we praise you and we glorify you, 
we celebrate your goodness and your faithfulness 
and with the angels and all the saints 
we proclaim the hymn of your glory...
We who are about to receive his body and his blood,
strengthen us and renew us in his image...
Grant all the members of the Church 
to know how to read the signs of the times 
and to grow in fidelity to the Gospel. 
Make us attentive to all men 
so that we may share in charity 
their sorrows and their anguish, 
their hopes and their joys 
and show them the way of salvation.<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Romans <font dir="ltr">7,18-25a.</font>@@@@@I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. Indeed, to want what is right is within my reach, but not to carry it out.<br /><br />
For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do.<br /><br />
If I do what I do not want, then it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.<br /><br />
So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.<br /><br />
Deep within myself, I delight in the law of God.<br /><br />
But in my members I see another law at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.<br /><br />
Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?<br /><br />
Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I serve the law of God, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">119(118),66.68.76.77.93.94.</font>@@@@@Teach me discernment and knowledge, <br /><br />
for I trust in your commandments.<br /><br />
You are good and do good: teach me your statutes.
May your faithful love be my comfort <br /><br />
according to your promise to your servant!<br /><br />
Let your compassion come to me, that I may live: <br /><br />
<br />
for your law is my delight.<br /><br />
I will never forget your precepts: through them you give me life.<br /><br />
I am yours: save me, for I seek your precepts.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">12,54-59.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to the crowds: “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once that it is going to rain; and so it happens.<br /><br />
And when you see the south wind blowing, you say there will be scorching heat; and it happens.<br /><br />
Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky; but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?<br /><br />
And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?<br /><br />
Thus, when you go with your opponent before the magistrate, on the way make every effort to settle with him, lest he drag you before the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.<br /><br />
I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the very last penny.”<br />
