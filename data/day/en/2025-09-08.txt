<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Virgin Mary, beloved of God</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
Nothing was ever as close to God as the blessed and all-wonderful Virgin Mary. What could be purer? What could be more blameless? She was so passionately loved by God, the supreme and infinitely pure light, that He mingled substantially with her through the influx of the Holy Spirit and was born of her, a perfect man, while retaining His own immutable and unadulterated nature. How marvelous!
In His immense love for mankind, God did not blush to take as His mother the one who was His servant. What condescension! In His infinite goodness, He did not hesitate to become the child of the one who had Himself fashioned her. He was truly enamored of the most gracious of His creatures, and He seized the one who was worth more than the powers of heaven. It is to her that the words of the prophet Zechariah apply: &quot;Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion, for behold, I come to dwell in your midst, says the Lord&quot; (Zechariah 2:14). (…)
&quot;Rejoice, house of the Lord, land on which God has trodden. You who have contained in your flesh the one whose divinity overflows all places. From you, the One who is simplicity itself took on the complex nature of man; the Eternal One entered into time and infinity into limits. &quot;Rejoice, full of grace&quot; (Luke 1:28): your work and your name are more joyful than any joy. From you came immortal joy, Christ, the remedy for human sorrow. Rejoice, paradise happier than the Garden of Eden, where all virtue sprouted and the tree of Life grew.&quot; and that all we need is a little good will to obtain it.<br />

Book of Micah <font dir="ltr">5,1-4a.</font>@@@@@The LORD says : You, Bethlehem-Ephrathah, too small to be among the clans of Judah, From you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel ; Whose origin is from of old, from ancient times.<br /><br />
(Therefore the Lord will give them up, until the time when she who is to give birth has borne, And the rest of his brethren shall return to the children of Israel.)<br /><br />
He shall stand firm and shepherd his flock by the strength of the LORD, in the majestic name of the LORD, his God; And they shall remain, for now his greatness shall reach to the ends of the earth;<br /><br />
he shall be peace.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">1,1-16.18-23.</font>@@@@@The Book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.<br /><br />
Abraham became the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.<br /><br />
Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,<br /><br />
Ram the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,<br /><br />
Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse,<br /><br />
Jesse the father of David the king. David became the father of Solomon, whose mother had been the wife of Uriah.<br /><br />
Solomon became the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asaph.<br /><br />
Asaph became the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah.<br /><br />
Uzziah became the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.<br /><br />
Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amos, Amos the father of Josiah.<br /><br />
Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.<br /><br />
After the Babylonian exile, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,<br /><br />
Zerubbabel the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,<br /><br />
Azor the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud,<br /><br />
Eliud the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,<br /><br />
Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary. Of her was born Jesus who is called the Messiah.<br /><br />
Now this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found with child through the holy Spirit.<br /><br />
Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man, yet unwilling to expose her to shame, decided to divorce her quietly.<br /><br />
Such was his intention when, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, &quot;Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home. For it is through the holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her.<br /><br />
She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.&quot;<br /><br />
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:<br /><br />
Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel, which means &quot;God is with us.&quot;<br />
