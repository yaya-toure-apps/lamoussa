<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">To love with the very love of God!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            [Saint Catherine heard God say to her:] Know this well, every imperfection or every perfection in love is manifested and acquired in relation to Me, and likewise in relation to one’s neighbor. Simple souls know this well, who often love creatures with a spiritual love. If they love Me with a purified and selfless love, it is also purely and selflessly that they love their neighbor.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            It is like the vessel that is filled at the fountain. If one takes it away from the source to drink, it soon becomes empty. But if one keeps it immersed in the source, one can always drink from it; it remains always full. So it is with love of neighbor, spiritual or temporal: it must be drunk in Me, without any other consideration. For I ask you to love Me with the same love with which I love you.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            In truth, you cannot do this completely. I loved you before being loved, and therefore, all the love you have for Me is a debt you repay, not a favor you do Me, while the love I have for you is a grace I bestow on you, but which I do not owe you. You cannot, therefore, return to Me the love that I ask of you. But I have placed you beside your neighbor, to allow you to do for him what you cannot do for Me: to love him by grace, and selflessly, without expecting any benefit. I then consider as done to Me what you do to your neighbor.<br />

Book of Ruth <font dir="ltr">1:1.3-6.14b-16.22.</font>@@@@@At the time when the Judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. A man of Bethlehem of Judah emigrated with his wife and his two sons to settle in the region called the Fields of Moab.<br /><br />
Elimelek, the husband of Naomi, died, and Naomi was left alone with her two sons, Mahlon and Chilion.<br /><br />
These took Moabite wives; one was named Orpah (that is: “Turned back”) and the other Ruth (that is: “Companion”). They remained there about ten years.<br /><br />
Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.<br /><br />
Then, with her daughters-in-law, she prepared to leave the Fields of Moab and return home, for she had heard that the Lord had visited His people and given them bread.<br /><br />
On the way, Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and left, but Ruth stayed close to her.<br /><br />
Naomi said to her: “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods. Return after your sister-in-law.”<br /><br />
But Ruth replied: “Do not force me to leave you and turn back from following you, for where you go, I will go; where you stay, I will stay; your people shall be my people, and your God my God.”<br /><br />
So Naomi returned from the Fields of Moab with her daughter-in-law, Ruth the Moabite. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">146(145):5-6.7.8-9a.9bc-10.</font>@@@@@Happy is he who relies on the God of Jacob, <br /><br />
who puts his hope in the Lord his God.<br /><br />
He who made heaven and earth <br /><br />
the sea and all that is in them! <br /><br />
<br /><br />
He keeps faith forever,<br /><br />
He gives justice to the oppressed; <br /><br />
to the hungry He gives bread;<br /><br />
the Lord sets prisoners free.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Lord opens the eyes of the blind, <br /><br />
the Lord raises up those who are bowed down,<br /><br />
the Lord loves the righteous,<br /><br />
the Lord protects the stranger.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He sustains the widow and the orphan,<br /><br />
but thwarts the way of the wicked.<br /><br />
The Lord shall reign for ever and ever: <br /><br />
your God, O Zion, through all generations!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">22:34-40.</font>@@@@@At that time, when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together,<br /><br />
and one of them, a lawyer, asked Jesus a question to test him:<br /><br />
“Teacher, in the Law, which is the great commandment?”<br /><br />
Jesus said to him: “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’<br /><br />
This is the great and first commandment.<br /><br />
And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’<br /><br />
On these two commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets.”<br />
