<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Make this proclamation: 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand' "</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
To carry out the will of the Father, Christ inaugurated the Kingdom of heaven on earth and revealed to us the mystery of that kingdom. By his obedience he brought about redemption. The Church, or, in other words, the kingdom of Christ now present in mystery, grows visibly through the power of God in the world. This inauguration and this growth are both symbolized by the blood and water which flowed from the open side of a crucified Jesus (Jn 19,34), and are foretold in the words of the Lord referring to his death on the Cross: &quot;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself&quot; (Jn 12,32)...
The mystery of the holy Church is manifest in its very foundation. The Lord Jesus set it on its course by preaching the Good News, that is, the coming of the Kingdom of God, which, for centuries, had been promised in the Scriptures: &quot;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand&quot; (Mk 1,15). In the word, in the works, and in the presence of Christ, this kingdom was clearly open to the view of men. The Word of the Lord is compared to a seed which is sown in a field (Mk 4,14); those who hear the Word with faith and become part of the little flock of Christ (Lk 12,32), have received the Kingdom itself. Then, by its own power the seed sprouts and grows until harvest time (Mk 4,26-29). The miracles of Jesus also confirm that the Kingdom has already arrived on earth: &quot;If I cast out devils by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you&quot; (Lk 11,20). Before all things, however, the Kingdom is clearly visible in the very person of Christ, the Son of God and the Son of Man, who came &quot;to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many&quot; (Mk 10,45).
When Jesus, who had suffered the death of the cross for mankind, had risen, he appeared as the one constituted as Lord, Christ and eternal Priest,(Acts 2,36; Heb 5,6) and he poured out on his disciples the Spirit promised by the Father.(Acts 2,33). From this source the Church, equipped with the gifts of its founder and faithfully guarding his precepts of charity, humility and self-sacrifice, receives the mission to proclaim and to spread among all peoples the Kingdom of Christ and of God and to be, on earth, the initial budding forth of that kingdom. While it slowly grows, the Church strains toward the completed Kingdom and, with all its strength, hopes and desires to be united in glory with its King.<br />

Second Letter to Timothy <font dir="ltr">4,10-17b.</font>@@@@@Beloved: Demas, enamored of the present world, deserted me and went to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.<br /><br />
Luke is the only one with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is helpful to me in the ministry.<br /><br />
I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.<br /><br />
When you come, bring the cloak I left with Carpus in Troas, the papyrus rolls, and especially the parchments.<br /><br />
Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.<br /><br />
You too be on guard against him, for he has strongly resisted our preaching.<br /><br />
At my first defense no one appeared on my behalf, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them!<br /><br />
But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the proclamation might be completed and all the Gentiles might hear it.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">10,1-9.</font>@@@@@The Lord Jesus appointed seventy-two others whom he sent ahead of him in pairs to every town and place he intended to visit.<br /><br />
He said to them, &quot;The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few; so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.<br /><br />
Go on your way; behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves.<br /><br />
Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals; and greet no one along the way.<br /><br />
Into whatever house you enter, first say, &#039;Peace to this household.&#039;<br /><br />
If a peaceful person lives there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.<br /><br />
Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you, for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from one house to another.<br /><br />
Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what is set before you,<br /><br />
cure the sick in it and say to them, &#039;The kingdom of God is at hand for you.&#039;&quot;<br />
