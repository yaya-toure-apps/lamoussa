	I think our Sisters have received that communication of joy that one sees among many religious who have given themselves unreservedly to God. The work is only the expression of the love we have for God. We have to pour our love on someone. And the people are the means of expressing our love for God.<br /><br />
We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass - grow in silence; see the stars, the moon and sun, how they move in silence. Is not our mission to give God to the poor in the slums? Not a dead God, but a living, loving God. The more we receive in silent prayer, the more we can give in our active life. We need silence to be able to touch souls. The essential thing is not what we say, but what God says to us and through us. All our words will be useless unless they come from within - words which do not give the light of Christ increase the darkness. 
 
Our progress in holiness depends on God and ourselves - on God&#039;s grace and on our will to be holy. We must have a real living determination to reach holiness. &#039;I will be a saint&#039; means I will despoil myself of all that is not God; I will strip my heart of all created things; I will live in poverty and detachment; I will renounce my will, my inclinations, my whims and fancies, and make myself a willing slave to the will of God.

Letter to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">2,6-15.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him,<br /><br />
rooted in him and built upon him and established in the faith as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.<br /><br />
See to it that no one captivate you with an empty, seductive philosophy according to human tradition, according to the elemental powers of the world and not according to Christ.<br /><br />
For in him dwells the whole fullness of the deity bodily,<br /><br />
and you share in this fullness in him, who is the head of every principality and power.<br /><br />
In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not administered by hand, by stripping off the carnal body, with the circumcision of Christ.<br /><br />
You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.<br /><br />
And even when you were dead in transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he brought you to life along with him, having forgiven us all our transgressions;<br /><br />
obliterating the bond against us, with its legal claims, which was opposed to us, he also removed it from our midst, nailing it to the cross.<br /><br />
despoiling the principalities and the powers, he made a public spectacle of them, leading them away in triumph by it.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">145(144),1-2.8-9.10-11.</font>@@@@@I will extol you, O my God and King,<br /><br />
and I will bless your name forever and ever.<br /><br />
Every day will I bless you,<br /><br />
and I will praise your name forever and ever.
The LORD is gracious and merciful,<br /><br />
slow to anger and of great kindness.<br /><br />
The LORD is good to all <br /><br />
and compassionate toward all his works.
Let all your works give you thanks, O LORD, <br /><br />
and let your faithful ones bless you.<br /><br />
Let them discourse of the glory of your Kingdom <br /><br />
and speak of your might.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">6,12-19.</font>@@@@@Jesus departed to the mountain to pray, and he spent the night in prayer to God.<br /><br />
When day came, he called his disciples to himself, and from them he chose Twelve, whom he also named apostles:<br /><br />
Simon, whom he named Peter, and his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,<br /><br />
Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called a Zealot,<br /><br />
and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.<br /><br />
And he came down with them and stood on a stretch of level ground. A great crowd of his disciples and a large number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon<br /><br />
came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and even those who were tormented by unclean spirits were cured.<br /><br />
Everyone in the crowd sought to touch him because power came forth from him and healed them all.<br />
