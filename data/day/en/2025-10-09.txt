<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find.”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      I know it well, O God, almighty Father: to offer myself to you so that everything in me... speaks of you, this is the principal duty of my life. You have granted me the gift of speech, and it can bring me no greater reward than the honor of serving you and of showing to the world that ignores you, to the heretic who denies you, who you are, you, the Father of the only-begotten Son of God. Yes, truly, this is my only desire! But I greatly need to implore the help of your mercy, so that, by the breath of your Spirit, you may swell the sails of my faith, stretched out for you, and push me to preach your holy name everywhere. For you did not make this promise in vain: “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened to you.” <br /><br />
<br />
      Poor as we are, we implore what we lack. We will devote ourselves with zeal to the study of your prophets and your apostles; we will knock at every door that our intelligence finds closed. But you alone can grant our prayer...; you alone can open this door at which we knock. You will encourage the difficult beginnings; you will strengthen our progress; and you will call us to share in the Spirit who guided your prophets and apostles. Thus we shall not give to their words a meaning other than the one they intended.<br /><br />
<br />
      Give us then the true meaning of words, the light of understanding, the beauty of expression, the faith in truth. Grant us to say what we believe...: that there is only one God, the Father, and one Lord, Jesus Christ.<br />

Book of Malachi <font dir="ltr">3:13-20a.</font>@@@@@“You have spoken harsh words against me, – says the Lord. And you dare to ask: ‘What have we said against you?’<br /><br />
This is what you have said: ‘Serving God is useless. What is the good of keeping his observances, of living a joyless life before the Lord of hosts?<br /><br />
We end up calling the arrogant blessed; even those who do evil prosper, even if they put God to the test, they escape!’”<br /><br />
Then those who feared the Lord spoke with one another. The Lord paid attention and listened to them; a book of remembrance was written before him in favor of those who fear him and who revere his name.<br /><br />
The Lord of hosts declared: “They shall be my special possession on the day I am preparing. I will have compassion on them, as a man has compassion on the son who serves him faithfully.<br /><br />
You will again see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between the one who serves God and the one who refuses to serve him.<br /><br />
For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace. All the arrogant, all evildoers, shall be stubble. The day that is coming shall set them ablaze, – says the Lord of hosts – so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.<br /><br />
But for you who fear my name, the Sun of righteousness shall rise, with healing in its rays.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">1:1-2.3.4.6.</font>@@@@@Happy is the man <br /><br />
who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, <br /><br />
who does not follow the way of sinners, <br /><br />
nor sit in the company of scoffers,<br /><br />
but delights in the law of the Lord <br /><br />
and meditates on his law day and night!<br /><br />
He is like a tree <br /><br />
planted beside a stream, <br /><br />
that yields its fruit in due season, <br /><br />
and its leaves never wither; <br /><br />
whatever he does prospers.<br /><br />
Not so the wicked. <br /><br />
<br />
They are like chaff <br /><br />
blown away by the wind.<br /><br />
The Lord knows the way of the righteous, <br /><br />
but the way of the wicked will perish.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">11:5-13.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to his disciples: “Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says: ‘My friend, lend me three loaves,<br /><br />
for a friend of mine has arrived from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.’<br /><br />
And if the other answers from within: ‘Do not bother me! The door is already locked; my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.’<br /><br />
I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything out of friendship, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.<br /><br />
So I say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.<br /><br />
For everyone who asks receives; and the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, it will be opened.<br /><br />
What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent?<br /><br />
or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?<br /><br />
If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”<br />
