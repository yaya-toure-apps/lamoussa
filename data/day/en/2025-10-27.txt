<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Sabbath becomes the first day of the new creation</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
	It is obvious that a week comprises seven days: God gave us six of them on which to work and one on which to pray, take our rest and be freed from our sins… I am going to expound to you the reasons for which our tradition of keeping Sundays and abstaining from work has been transmitted to us. When the Lord entrusted the sacrament to his disciples: “He took bread, said the blessing, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying: ‘Take, eat: this is my body, broken for you for the remission of sins.’ In the same way, he gave them the cup, saying: ‘Drink from it all of you: this is my blood, the blood of the New Covenant, shed for you and for many for the remission of sins. Do this in remembrance of me’” (Mt 26,26f.; 1Cor 11,24).
Thus the holy day of Sunday is that on which we make a memorial of the Lord. That is why it is called “the Lord’s day”. And it is, as it were, the lord of days. In fact, before the Passion of the Lord, it was not called “the Lord’s day” but “the first day”. It was on this day that the Lord established a foundation for the resurrection, that is to say he carried out the work of creation; on this day he gave the world the firstfruits of the resurrection; on this day, as we have said, he ordained the celebration of the holy mysteries. Thus this day has become a beginning for us of every grace: the beginning of the creation of the world, the beginning of the resurrection, the beginning of the week. This day, which encloses within itself three beginnings, prefigures the primacy of the Holy Trinity.<br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">8,12-17.</font>@@@@@Consequently, brothers, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.<br /><br />
For if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.<br /><br />
For those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.<br /><br />
For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you received a spirit of adoption, through which we cry, &quot;Abba, Father!&quot;<br /><br />
The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,<br /><br />
and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if only we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">68(67),2.4.6-7ab.20-21.</font>@@@@@God arises; his enemies are scattered, <br /><br />
and those who hate him flee before him.<br /><br />
But the just rejoice and exult before God; <br /><br />
they are glad and rejoice.
The father of orphans and the defender of widows <br /><br />
is God in his holy dwelling.<br /><br />
God gives a home to the forsaken;<br /><br />
he leads forth prisoners to prosperity.
Blessed day by day be the Lord, <br /><br />
who bears our burdens; God, who is our salvation.<br /><br />
God is a saving God for us; <br /><br />
the LORD, my Lord, controls the passageways of death.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">13,10-17.</font>@@@@@Jesus was teaching in a synagogue on the sabbath.<br /><br />
And a woman was there who for eighteen years had been crippled by a spirit; she was bent over, completely incapable of standing erect.<br /><br />
When Jesus saw her, he called to her and said, &quot;Woman, you are set free of your infirmity.&quot;<br /><br />
He laid his hands on her, and she at once stood up straight and glorified God.<br /><br />
But the leader of the synagogue, indignant that Jesus had cured on the sabbath, said to the crowd in reply, &quot;There are six days when work should be done. Come on those days to be cured, not on the sabbath day.&quot;<br /><br />
The Lord said to him in reply, &quot;Hypocrites! Does not each one of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his ass from the manger and lead it out for watering?<br /><br />
This daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for eighteen years now, ought she not to have been set free on the sabbath day from this bondage?&quot;<br /><br />
When he said this, all his adversaries were humiliated; and the whole crowd rejoiced at all the splendid deeds done by him.<br />
