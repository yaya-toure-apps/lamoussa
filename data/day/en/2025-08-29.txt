<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Forerunner of Christ in his birth and in his death</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            Let us admire John the Baptist above all because of the following testimony:&nbsp;«&nbsp;Among those born of women, no one is greater than John the Baptist&nbsp;» (Lk 7:28)&nbsp;; he deserved to rise to such a reputation for virtue that many thought he was the Christ (Lk 3:15).  But what is even more admirable:&nbsp;Herod the tetrarch enjoyed royal power and was able to put him to death whenever he wished. Now, he had committed an unjust act contrary to the law of Moses by taking his brother’s wife. John, without fear of him, without showing partiality, without worrying about royal power, without fearing death (...), without hiding from all these dangers, rebuked Herod with the freedom of the prophets and reproached him for his marriage. Thrown into prison for this boldness, he cared neither for death nor for a trial with an uncertain outcome, but in his chains his thoughts went to Christ whom he had proclaimed. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Unable to go to him in person, he sent his disciples to ask:&nbsp;«&nbsp;Are you the one who is to come, or should we wait for another?&nbsp;» (Lk 7:19) Note well that, even in prison, John was teaching. Even there he had disciples;&nbsp;even in prison John fulfilled his duty as master and instructed his disciples with conversations about God. In these circumstances, the question of Jesus was raised, and John therefore sent some of his disciples to him. (...)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            The disciples returned and reported to their master what the Savior had charged them to announce. This response was for John a weapon to face the combat;&nbsp;he died with confidence and with great courage allowed himself to be beheaded, assured by the very word of the Lord that the one in whom he believed was truly the Son of God. Such was the freedom of John the Baptist, such was the madness of Herod who, to many crimes, added first the imprisonment, then the murder of John the Baptist.<br />

Book of Jeremiah <font dir="ltr">1:17-19.</font>@@@@@In those days, the word of the Lord was addressed to me: <br /><br />
« Gird up your loins; stand up, and say to them all that I command you. Do not be terrified before them, or I will terrify you before them.<br /><br />
Today I make you a fortified city, a pillar of iron, a wall of bronze, to confront the whole land, the kings of Judah and its princes, its priests and all the people of the land.<br /><br />
They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail over you, for I am with you to deliver you – oracle of the Lord. »<br />

let me never be put to shame.<br /><br />
In your justice, rescue me, set me free, <br /><br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark <font dir="ltr">6:17-29.</font>@@@@@At that time, Herod had given the order to arrest John the Baptist and chain him in prison, because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, whom he had taken as his own.<br /><br />
Indeed, John kept saying to him: « You do not have the right to take your brother’s wife. »<br /><br />
So Herodias had a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she could not<br /><br />
because Herod feared John: he knew that he was a just and holy man, and he protected him; when he heard him, he was very perplexed; yet he liked to listen to him.<br /><br />
Now, a favorable occasion came on Herod’s birthday, when he gave a banquet for his dignitaries, the military chiefs, and the notables of Galilee.<br /><br />
The daughter of Herodias came in and danced. She pleased Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl: « Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you. »<br /><br />
And he made this oath to her: « Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom. »<br /><br />
She went out and said to her mother: « What shall I ask for? » Herodias replied: « The head of John the Baptizer. »<br /><br />
Immediately the girl hurried back to the king and made this request: « I want you to give me right now, on a platter, the head of John the Baptist. »<br /><br />
The king was deeply distressed; but because of his oath and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.<br /><br />
At once he sent a guard with the order to bring John’s head. The guard went and beheaded John in the prison.<br /><br />
He brought the head on a platter, gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.<br /><br />
When John’s disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.<br />
