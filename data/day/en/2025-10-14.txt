In my opinion, if I had understood as I do now that in this little palace of my soul dwelt so great a King, I would not have left Him alone so often. I would have remained with Him at times and striven more so as not to be so unclean. But what a marvelous thing, that He who would fill a thousand worlds and many more with His grandeur would enclose Himself in something so small! In fact, since He is Lord He is free to do what He wants, and since He loves us He adapts Himself to our size. 
So that the soul won&#039;t be disturbed in the beginning by seeing that it is too small to have something so great within itself, the Lord doesn&#039;t give it this knowledge until He enlarges it little by little and it has the capacity to receive what He will place within it. For this reason I say He is free to do what He wants since He has the power to make this palace a large one. The whole point is that we should give ourselves to Him with complete determination, and we should empty the soul in such a way that He can store things there or take them away as though it were His own property. And since His Majesty has the rights of ownership, let us not oppose Him. And since He doesn&#039;t force our will, He takes what we give Him; but He doesn&#039;t give Himself completely until we give ourselves completely. 
This fact is certain; and because it is so important, I bring it to your minds so often. He never works in the soul as He does when it is totally His without any obstacle, nor do I see how He could. He is the friend of all good order. Now, then, if we fill the palace with lowly people and trifles, how will there be room for the Lord with His court? He does enough by remaining just a little while in the midst of so much confusion. <br /><br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">1,16-25.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: I am not ashamed of the Gospel. It is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: for Jew first, and then Greek.<br /><br />
For in it is revealed the righteousness of God from faith to faith; as it is written, &quot;The one who is righteous by faith will live.&quot;<br /><br />
The wrath of God is indeed being revealed from heaven against every impiety and wickedness of those who suppress the truth by their wickedness.<br /><br />
For what can be known about God is evident to them, because God made it evident to them.<br /><br />
Ever since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes of eternal power and divinity have been able to be understood and perceived in what he has made. As a result, they have no excuse;<br /><br />
for although they knew God they did not accord him glory as God or give him thanks. Instead, they became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless minds were darkened.<br /><br />
While claiming to be wise, they became fools<br /><br />
and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for the likeness of an image of mortal man or of birds or of four-legged animals or of snakes.<br /><br />
Therefore, God handed them over to impurity through the lusts of their hearts for the mutual degradation of their bodies.<br /><br />
They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and revered and worshiped the creature rather than the creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">19(18),2-3.4-5.</font>@@@@@The heavens declare the glory of God; <br /><br />
and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.<br /><br />
Day pours out the word to day, <br /><br />
and night to night imparts knowledge.
Not a word nor a discourse <br /><br />
whose voice is not heard;<br /><br />
Through all the earth their voice resounds, <br /><br />
and to the ends of the world, their message.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">11,37-41.</font>@@@@@After Jesus had spoken, a Pharisee invited him to dine at his home. He entered and reclined at table to eat.<br /><br />
The Pharisee was amazed to see that he did not observe the prescribed washing before the meal.<br /><br />
The Lord said to him, &quot;Oh you Pharisees! Although you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, inside you are filled with plunder and evil.<br /><br />
You fools! Did not the maker of the outside also make the inside?<br /><br />
But as to what is within, give alms, and behold, everything will be clean for you.&quot;<br />
