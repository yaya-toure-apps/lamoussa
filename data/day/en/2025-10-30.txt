Christ’s cross supports the human race: upon this column is his house built. When I speak of the cross I’m not thinking about its wood but about the Passion. This cross is to be found as much in Britain as in India, and in the entire world… Happy are they who bear the cross and resurrection in their hearts and the place of Christ’s birth and place of ascension too. Happy are they who possess Bethlehem in their hearts and in whose heart Christ is born each day… Happy are they in whose heart Christ rises to life each day because each day they do penance for their sins, even the lightest. Happy are they who ascend each day from the Mount of Olives to the Kingdom of heaven where the olives are fat ones and the light of Christ is born…
It is not because we have been to Jerusalem but because we have lived a good life in Jerusalem that we should pride ourselves. The city we are to seek is not that which killed the prophets and shed the blood of Christ but that which a stream gladdens in its flood (Ps 45[46],5), which, built on a mountain top, cannot be hidden (Mt 5,12), which the apostle Paul declares to be mother of the saints and in which he rejoices to dwell with the just (cf. Gal 4,26-27).<br />

Letter to the Romans <font dir="ltr">8,31b-39.</font>@@@@@Brothers and sisters: If God is for us, who can be against us?<br /><br />
He who did not spare his own Son but handed him over for us all, how will he not also give us everything else along with him?<br /><br />
Who will bring a charge against God&#039;s chosen ones? It is God who acquits us.<br /><br />
Who will condemn? It is Christ (Jesus) who died, rather, was raised, who also is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us.<br /><br />
What will separate us from the love of Christ? Will anguish, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?<br /><br />
As it is written: &quot;For your sake we are being slain all the day; we are looked upon as sheep to be slaughtered.&quot;<br /><br />
No, in all these things we conquer overwhelmingly through him who loved us.<br /><br />
For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor present things, nor future things, nor powers,<br /><br />
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">109(108),21-22.26-27.30-31.</font>@@@@@Do you, O GOD, my Lord, deal kindly with me for your name’s sake;<br /><br />
in your generous mercy rescue me;<br /><br />
For I am wretched and poor,<br /><br />
and my heart is pierced within me.
Help me, O LORD, my God;<br /><br />
save me, in your mercy,<br /><br />
And let them know that this is your hand;<br /><br />
that you, O LORD, have done this.
I will speak my thanks earnestly to the LORD,<br /><br />
and in the midst of the throng I will praise him,<br /><br />
For he stood at the right hand of the poor man,<br /><br />
to save him from those who would condemn his soul.<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">13,31-35.</font>@@@@@Some Pharisees came to Jesus and said, &quot;Go away, leave this area because Herod wants to kill you.&quot;<br /><br />
He replied, &quot;Go and tell that fox, &#039;Behold, I cast out demons and I perform healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I accomplish my purpose.<br /><br />
Yet I must continue on my way today, tomorrow, and the following day, for it is impossible that a prophet should die outside of Jerusalem.&#039;<br /><br />
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how many times I yearned to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were unwilling!<br /><br />
Behold, your house will be abandoned. (But) I tell you, you will not see me until (the time comes when) you say, &#039;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&#039;&quot;<br />
