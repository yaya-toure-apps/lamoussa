The communion of life between Joseph and Jesus leads us to consider once again the mystery of the Incarnation, precisely in reference to the humanity of Jesus as the efficacious instrument of his divinity for the purpose of sanctifying man: &quot;By virtue of his divinity, Christ&#039;s human actions were salvific for us, causing grace within us, either by merit or by a certain efficacy.&quot;(St. Thomas of Aquino)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Among those actions, the gospel writers highlight those which have to do with the Paschal Mystery, but they also underscore the importance of physical contact with Jesus…The apostolic witness did not neglect the story of Jesus&#039; birth, his circumcision, his presentation in the Temple, his flight into Egypt and his hidden life in Nazareth. It recognized the &quot;mystery&quot; of grace present in each of these saving &quot;acts,&quot; in as much as they all share the same source of love: the divinity of Christ. If through Christ&#039;s humanity this love shone on all mankind, the first beneficiaries were undoubtedly those whom the divine will had most intimately associated with itself: Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and Joseph, his presumed father.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Why should the &quot;fatherly&quot; love of Joseph not have had an influence upon the &quot;filial&quot; love of Jesus? And vice versa why should the &quot;filial&quot; love of Jesus not have had an influence upon the &quot;fatherly&quot; love of Joseph, thus leading to a further deepening of their unique relationship? Those souls most sensitive to the impulses of divine love have rightly seen in Joseph a brilliant example of the interior life.<br />

Psalms <font dir="ltr">81(80),3-4.5-6ab.10-11ab.</font>@@@@@Take up a melody, and sound the timbrel, <br /><br />
the pleasant harp and the lyre.<br /><br />
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, <br /><br />
at the full moon, on our solemn feast.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For it is a statute in Israel, <br /><br />
an ordinance of the God of Jacob,<br /><br />
Who made it a decree for Joseph<br /><br />
when he came forth from the land of Egypt.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
“There shall be no strange god among you <br /><br />
nor shall you worship any alien god.<br /><br />
I, the LORD, am your God<br /><br />
who led you forth from the land of Egypt.&quot;<br />
