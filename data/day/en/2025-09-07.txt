<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Offering God our true wealth</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
We see some people who disdain very great riches in this world - and not only large sums of gold and silver but also magnificent properties - being disturbed over a penknife, a stylus, a needle, or a pen... And when they have given away all their wealth for the sake of Christ&#039;s love, but still retain the heart&#039;s old affection for the littlest things and are always quickly irritated because of them, they become in every respect fruitless and barren, like those who do not have the love of which the Apostle speaks. Foreseeing this in the Spirit, the blessed Apostle said: &quot;If I gave all my goods to feed the poor and handed my body over to be burned, but I did not have love, it would profit me nothing.&quot; (1 Cor 13:3) Hence it is clearly proved that perfection is not immediately arrived at by being stripped and deprived of all one&#039;s wealth or by giving up one&#039;s honors, unless there is that love whose elements the Apostle describes, which consists in purity of heart alone. 
For what else does it mean not to be envious, not to be boastful, not to be angry, not to do evil, not to seek the things that are one&#039;s own, not to rejoice over iniquity, not to think evil and all the rest, (1 Cor 13:4-5) if not always to offer God a perfect and utterly clean heart and to keep it unsullied by any passion? For the sake of this, then, everything is to be done and desired.<br /><br />

Book of Wisdom <font dir="ltr">9,13-18.</font>@@@@@Who can know God&#039;s counsel, or who can conceive what the LORD intends?<br /><br />
For the deliberations of mortals are timid, and unsure are our plans.<br /><br />
For the corruptible body burdens the soul and the earthen shelter weighs down the mind that has many concerns.<br /><br />
And scarce do we guess the things on earth, and what is within our grasp we find with difficulty; but when things are in heaven, who can search them out?<br /><br />
Or who ever knew your counsel, except you had given Wisdom and sent your holy spirit from on high?<br /><br />
And thus were the paths of those on earth made straight.

Psalms <font dir="ltr">90(89),3-4.5-6.12-13.14.17.</font>@@@@@You turn man back to dust, <br /><br />
saying, &quot;Return, O children of men.&quot;<br /><br />
For a thousand years in your sight <br /><br />
are as yesterday, now that it is past, <br /><br />
or as a watch of the night.
You make an end of them in their sleep; <br /><br />
the next morning they are like the changing grass,<br /><br />
Which at dawn springs up anew, <br /><br />
but by evening wilts and fades.
Teach us to number our days aright, <br /><br />
that we may gain wisdom of heart.<br /><br />
Return, O LORD! How long? <br /><br />
Have pity on your servants!
Fill us at daybreak with your kindness, <br /><br />
that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days.<br /><br />
And may the gracious care of the LORD our God be ours; <br /><br />
Prosper the work of our hands for us! <br /><br />
Prosper the work of our hands!<br />

Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">14,25-33.</font>@@@@@Great crowds were traveling with Jesus, and he turned and addressed them,<br /><br />
&quot;If any one comes to me without hating his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.<br /><br />
Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.<br /><br />
Which of you wishing to construct a tower does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if there is enough for its completion?<br /><br />
Otherwise, after laying the foundation and finding himself unable to finish the work the onlookers should laugh at him<br /><br />
and say, &#039;This one began to build but did not have the resources to finish.&#039;<br /><br />
Or what king marching into battle would not first sit down and decide whether with ten thousand troops he can successfully oppose another king advancing upon him with twenty thousand troops?<br /><br />
But if not, while he is still far away, he will send a delegation to ask for peace terms.<br /><br />
In the same way, anyone of you who does not renounce all his possessions cannot be my disciple.&quot;<br />

Letter to Philemon <font dir="ltr">1,9-10.12-17.</font>@@@@@I, Paul, an old man, and now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus,<br /><br />
I urge you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whose father I have become in my imprisonment,<br /><br />
I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.<br /><br />
I should have liked to retain him for myself, so that he might serve me on your behalf in my imprisonment for the gospel,<br /><br />
but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that the good you do might not be forced but voluntary.<br /><br />
Perhaps this is why he was away from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,<br /><br />
no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a brother, beloved especially to me, but even more so to you, as a man and in the Lord.<br /><br />
So if you regard me as a partner, welcome him as you would me.<br />
