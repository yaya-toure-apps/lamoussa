<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“I have come to cast fire upon the earth; and how I wish that it were already kindled!” (Lk 12:49)</font>
<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            Our Lord Jesus Christ lives on earth in souls and grows within them according to the operations of His grace, just as He did in His childhood, conversing with His Mother, and He continues His interior life in us when we are solely His. What He began in Himself, He continues in His Church, so that the divine life He communicates to her, which is so glorious to God His Father, will never end in eternity. He desires that the whole earth be full of fire, and He sent it down here only that it might consume the world (cf. Lk 12:49). (…)
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            There is nothing sweeter, nor anything that gives more rest and consolation to the soul, than to be rapt out of oneself by Jesus Christ and by His divine Spirit, who does not need Elijah's fiery chariot for this (cf. 2 Kgs 2:11)&nbsp;; but who, by His sole power, raises us from earth to heaven, and from the depths of ourselves transports us into the bosom of God. I would be unfaithful to Jesus if I did not incessantly urge your soul to prevent it from resting on itself for a single moment.<br />

Book of Jeremiah <font dir="ltr">38:4-6, 8-10.</font>
Then the princes said to King Zedekiah, “Let this man be put to death, for by speaking in this way he is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, and all the people. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.”<br /><br />
King Zedekiah answered, “He is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.”<br /><br />
So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s son, which was in the court of the guard. They let Jeremiah down with ropes. And in the cistern there was no water, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.<br /><br />
Then Ebed-Melech came out of the king’s house and spoke to the king, saying,<br /><br />
“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city.”<br /><br />
Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, “Take thirty men with you from here, and pull Jeremiah the prophet up from the cistern before he dies.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">40(39):2-4, 18.</font>
With great hope<br /><br />
I waited for the Lord;<br /><br />
he inclined to me<br /><br />
and heard my cry.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He drew me up from the pit of destruction,<br /><br />
out of the miry bog,<br /><br />
and set my feet upon a rock,<br /><br />
making my steps secure.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He put a new song in my mouth,<br /><br />
a song of praise to our God.<br /><br />
Many will see and fear,<br /><br />
and put their trust in the Lord.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As for me, I am poor and needy,<br /><br />
but the Lord takes thought for me.<br /><br />
You are my help and my deliverer;<br /><br />
do not delay, O my God!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">12:49-53.</font>
At that time, Jesus said to his disciples: “I have come to cast fire upon the earth; and how I wish that it were already kindled!<br /><br />
I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!<br /><br />
Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.<br /><br />
For from now on, five in one household will be divided: three against two and two against three;<br /><br />
they will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”<br />

Letter to the Hebrews <font dir="ltr">12:1-4.</font>
Brothers and sisters, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,<br /><br />
looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.<br /><br />
Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or faint-hearted.<br /><br />
In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.<br />
