<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Blessed is that servant…" (Lk 12:43)</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            Hurry, all the more, for time is short (cf. 1 Cor 7:29). Sow virtues in your hearts, so that you may reap a harvest of righteousness (cf. Phil 1:11). Let no one be discouraged, lest they hear the author of Proverbs say:&amp;nbsp;“Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise” (Prov 6:6).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Let no one be deceitful or disloyal, acting in one way and speaking in another, lest they be rejected, according to the words of the holy psalmist David:&amp;nbsp;“The Lord will cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaks proud things” (Ps 11:4). Let no one be idle, slack, or dissolute in soul and body, lest this reproach from the divine Paul be inflicted upon them:&amp;nbsp;“If anyone will not work, neither should he eat” (2 Thess 3:10). Let no one be proud, lest they be targeted by these words of the divine James:&amp;nbsp;“God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble” (Jas 4:6;&amp;nbsp;1 Pet 5:5).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            But let all of us walk wide awake in the Lord, accomplish his commandments, bring to what is, in a way, the common treasury (cf. Mk 41-44) of our life the contribution that is within our power (…). Let absolutely no one appear before the eyes of the living God with empty hands (cf. Mk 12:41-44)&amp;nbsp;! For he accepts not only the offering of burdensome tasks, but also that of the smallest (…)&amp;nbsp;, just as he accepted the widow's two small coins;&amp;nbsp;God, indeed, measures intentions and it is by them that he judges actions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Therefore, my children, since we have a good God full of mercy, who desires our salvation more than we do, let us walk on his straight path and we will find rest for our souls (cf. Mt 11:29;&amp;nbsp;Jer 6:16).<br />

Book of Wisdom <font dir="ltr">18:6-9.</font>@@@@@That night had been made known beforehand to our fathers; assured of the promises in which they had believed, they were joyful.<br /><br />
And your people welcomed at once the salvation of the righteous and the ruin of their enemies.<br /><br />
While you were striking our adversaries, you were calling us to glory.<br /><br />
In the secrecy of their homes, the faithful descendants of the righteous offered a sacrifice, and they consecrated by common accord this divine law: that the saints would share both the best and the worst; and already they were intoning the songs of praise of the Fathers.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">33(32):1,12,18-19,20,22.</font>@@@@@Shout for joy in the Lord, O you righteous! <br /><br />
To the upright, praise is fitting!<br /><br />
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, <br /><br />
the people whom he has chosen for his inheritance!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Lord watches over those who fear him, <br /><br />
who hope in his steadfast love,<br /><br />
to deliver their soul from death, <br /><br />
and to keep them alive in famine.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Our soul waits for the Lord; <br /><br />
he is our help and our shield.<br /><br />
Let your steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us, <br /><br />
even as we hope in you!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">12:32-48.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to his disciples: "Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.<br /><br />
Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide yourselves with purses that will not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.<br /><br />
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.<br /><br />
Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning,<br /><br />
as if you were waiting for your master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks, you can open the door for him at once.<br /><br />
Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will put on an apron and have them recline at table, and he will come and wait on them.<br /><br />
If he comes during the second or third watch of the night and finds them ready, blessed are those servants!<br /><br />
But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.<br /><br />
You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him."<br /><br />
Peter asked, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?"<br /><br />
The Lord answered, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master will put in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?<br /><br />
Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing so when he arrives.<br /><br />
Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.<br /><br />
But if that servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,<br /><br />
then the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unfaithful.<br /><br />
That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows.<br /><br />
But the one who does not know it and does things deserving of blows will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked."<br />

Letter to the Hebrews <font dir="ltr">11:1-2,8-19.</font>@@@@@Brothers, faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.<br /><br />
And it was by faith that the elders obtained a good report.<br /><br />
By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.<br /><br />
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign country, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs of the same promise,<br /><br />
for he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.<br /><br />
By faith even Sarah herself, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to conceive a child because she considered him faithful who had made the promise.<br /><br />
So from this one man, already as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.<br /><br />
All these people died in faith, without having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.<br /><br />
For people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.<br /><br />
If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.<br /><br />
But in fact, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.<br /><br />
By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son,<br /><br />
even though God had said to him, ‘Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.’<br /><br />
Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a figurative sense he did receive Isaac back from death.<br />
