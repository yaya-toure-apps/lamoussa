            God is not content to be the object of natural knowledge and love on the part of men; but He calls us to share His very life and His own beatitude. By a movement of infinite love towards us, God wills to be for our souls not only the sovereign master of all things, but a friend, a father. He wills that we know Him as He knows Himself, source of all truth and all beauty, here below in the darkness of faith, there above in the light of glory; – He wills that we possess Him Himself, infinite Good and source of all beatitude, here below and there above through love.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            To this end, as you know, He raises our nature above itself, adorning it with sanctifying grace, infused virtues, and the gifts of the Spirit. God wills to be Himself, through the communication of His infinite and eternal life, our perfect beatitude. He does not want us to find our happiness outside of Himself, fullness of all good; He leaves no creature the power to satisfy our heart: "I Myself will be your reward exceedingly great" (Gen 15:1 Vg). And Our Lord confirmed this promise at the moment He was about to pay its price by His bloody sacrifice: "Where I am, I desire, O Father, that My own may be also, that they may witness My glory, that they may share Our joy and that Your love may fill them" (Jn 17:24, 26). Such is the sole and supreme goal towards which we must strive.<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Galatians <font dir="ltr">2:19-20.</font>@@@@@Brothers, through the Law, I died to the Law that I might live for God; with Christ, I am crucified.<br /><br />
I live, but it is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me. What I now live in the flesh, I live in faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">34(33):2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11.</font>@@@@@I will bless the Lord at all times, <br /><br />
His praise continually on my lips.<br /><br />
In the Lord my soul shall make its boast; <br /><br />
let the humble hear and be glad!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Magnify the Lord with me, <br /><br />
and let us exalt His name together.<br /><br />
I sought the Lord, and He heard me, <br /><br />
and delivered me from all my fears.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Look to Him and be radiant; <br /><br />
let your faces not be ashamed.<br /><br />
This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, <br /><br />
and saved him out of all his troubles.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord encamps <br /><br />
around those who fear Him, and delivers them.<br /><br />
Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good; <br /><br />
blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Fear the Lord, you His saints, <br /><br />
for those who fear Him lack nothing.<br /><br />
The young lions suffer want and hunger; <br /><br />
but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John <font dir="ltr">15:1-8.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: "I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser.<br /><br />
Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes, that it may bear more fruit.<br /><br />
You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.<br /><br />
Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me.<br /><br />
I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.<br /><br />
If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and withers; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned.<br /><br />
If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.<br /><br />
By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples."<br />
