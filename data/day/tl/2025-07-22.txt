<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">Blessed is he who is visited by the Word!</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
                “Bear with me in a little foolishness” (2 Cor 11:1). I confess – and I say this with all simplicity – that the Word has visited me, and indeed very often. But although he has entered me frequently, I have never, at any time, felt the moment of his coming. I felt that he was present; I remember that he was with me; I was sometimes even able to foresee that he would come; but I never felt his coming or his departure. How did he come or go? I do not know.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
               It is not through the eyes that he enters, for he has neither form nor color that we can discern; it is not through the ears, for his coming produces no sound; nor can his presence be recognized by touch, for he is intangible. By what way then did he come? Should we believe that he did not enter at all since he does not come from outside? He is not, in fact, among external things. But on the other hand, he cannot come from within me, since he is good and in me, I know, there is nothing good.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
               I ascended to the peak of myself, and I saw that the Word resided even higher. Exploring with curiosity, I descended to the lowest part of my being, and he was found even lower. When I turned my gaze outward, I discovered that he was beyond everything external to me; then I turned inward, and he was even further within. Finally, I recognized the truth of those words I had read in Scripture: “In him we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17:28). Blessed is he in whom the Word is, who lives for him and is moved by him!<br />

Song of Songs <font dir="ltr">3:1-4a.</font>@@@@@Words of the Beloved.<br /><br />
On my bed at night I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not.<br /><br />
I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but found him not.<br /><br />
The watchmen found me as they went about the city: “Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”<br /><br />
Scarcely had I passed them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">63(62):2.3-4.5-6.8-9.</font>@@@@@O God, you are my God; <br /><br />
earnestly I seek you; <br /><br />
my soul thirsts for you; <br /><br />
my flesh faints for you, <br /><br />
as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, <br /><br />
beholding your power and glory.<br /><br />
Because your steadfast love is better than life, <br /><br />
my lips will praise you.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So I will bless you as long as I live; <br /><br />
in your name I will lift up my hands.<br /><br />
My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, <br /><br />
and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For you have been my help, <br /><br />
and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.<br /><br />
My soul clings to you; <br /><br />
your right hand upholds me.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John <font dir="ltr">20:1,11-18.</font>@@@@@Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.<br /><br />
But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb.<br /><br />
And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet.<br /><br />
They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.”<br /><br />
Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabbouni!” (which means Teacher).<br /><br />
Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”<br /><br />
Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” and told them what he had said to her.<br />
