« The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls »@@@@@<br />
In search of your pearl<br /><br />
I did not set myself as the merchant;<br /><br />
And I did not, in exchange for the Unexchangeable,<br /><br />
Give the love of the ephemeral.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I did not sell, according to the commandment,<br /><br />
The concupiscence of the earthly,<br /><br />
In order to acquire that which is of great price:<br /><br />
The morning star, born of the Dew.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
O You who were born of the Virgin in the manner of the pearl,<br /><br />
God and man, the two forming but one,<br /><br />
Grant that by Your divine love<br /><br />
I may be the beggar with a wounded heart!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Open my nuptial chamber, I who sigh;<br /><br />
Enter the dwelling with affection of heart;<br /><br />
Make me again Your dwelling place<br /><br />
And embrace me with Your right hand.<br />

Psaume 99(98),5.6.7.9.@@@@@Exalt the Lord our God, <br /><br />
worship at his footstool, <br /><br />
for he is holy!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel, the Suppliant, <br /><br />
all, they supplicated the Lord, <br /><br />
and he answered them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud; <br /><br />
they kept his testimonies, <br /><br />
and the statutes he gave them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Exalt the Lord our God, <br /><br />
and worship at his holy mountain, <br /><br />
for the Lord our God is holy.<br />
