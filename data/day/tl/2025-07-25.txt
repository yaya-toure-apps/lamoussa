<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">«&nbsp;He said to them: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem&nbsp;»</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;«&nbsp;It is in vain that you rise before daybreak&nbsp;» (Ps 126,2). What does this mean? ... Christ, our Day, has risen; it is good for you to rise after Christ and not before him. Who are those who rise before Christ? ... Those who wish to be exalted here below, where he was humble. Let them therefore be humble in this world if they wish to be exalted where Christ is exalted. Indeed, he said of those who had adhered to him through faith — and we are precisely among them:&nbsp;«&nbsp;Father, those whom you have given me, I desire that where I am, they also may be with me&nbsp;» (Jn 17,25). Magnificent gift, great grace, glorious promise... Do you wish to be where he is exalted? Be humble where he was humble.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;«&nbsp;A disciple is not above his teacher&nbsp;» (Mt 10,24)... And yet, the sons of Zebedee, before having undergone humiliation in conformity with the Lord&nbsp;’s Passion, had already chosen their place, one at his right hand, the other at his left. They wanted to &nbsp;«&nbsp;rise before the Day&nbsp;»; that is why they walked in vain. The Lord recalled them to humility by asking them:&nbsp;«&nbsp;Can you drink the chalice that I am to drink? I came to be humble, and do you wish to be exalted before me? Follow me, he said, in the way I go. For if you wish to go by a way I do not go, it is in vain.&nbsp;»<br />

Second Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians <font dir="ltr">4,7-15.</font>@@@@@Brothers, we carry a treasure in earthen vessels, so that it may be clearly seen that this extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us.<br /><br />
In every circumstance, we are afflicted, but not distressed; we are perplexed, but not driven to despair;<br /><br />
we are persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.<br /><br />
Always we carry in our body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.<br /><br />
Indeed, we, the living, are constantly being given over to death for Jesus&apos; sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our mortal flesh.<br /><br />
So death is at work in us, but life in you.<br /><br />
The Scripture says: &apos;I believed, therefore I spoke.&apos; And we also, who have the same spirit of faith, believe, and therefore we speak.<br /><br />
For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will place us with him and with you.<br /><br />
And all this is for your sake, so that grace, more widely spread among a greater number, may cause thanksgiving to abound for the glory of God.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">126(125),1-2ab.2cd-3.4-5.6.</font>@@@@@When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, <br /><br />
we were like those who dream!<br /><br />
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,<br /><br />
and our tongue with shouts of joy.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Then they said among the nations:<br /><br />
«&nbsp;The Lord has done great things for them!&nbsp;»<br /><br />
The Lord has done great things for us: <br /><br />
we are glad indeed!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Restore our fortunes, Lord, <br /><br />
like streams in the Negev.<br /><br />
Those who sow in tears <br /><br />
shall reap with shouts of joy.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He who goes forth weeping, <br /><br />
bearing the seed for sowing,<br />
shall come home with shouts of joy, <br /><br />
bringing his sheaves with him.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">20,20-28.</font>@@@@@At that time, the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Jesus with her sons James and John, and she knelt down to make a request of him.<br /><br />
Jesus said to her:&nbsp;«&nbsp;What do you want?&nbsp;» She replied:&nbsp;«&nbsp;Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your Kingdom.&nbsp;»<br /><br />
Jesus answered:&nbsp;«&nbsp;You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?&nbsp;» They said to him:&nbsp;«&nbsp;We can.&nbsp;»<br /><br />
He said to them:&nbsp;«&nbsp;My cup you will drink; but to sit at my right hand and at my left, this is not mine to grant; rather, it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.&nbsp;»<br /><br />
When the ten heard this, they became indignant with the two brothers.<br /><br />
Jesus called them to him and said:&nbsp;«&nbsp;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great ones make their authority over them felt.<br /><br />
It shall not be so among you: but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;<br /><br />
and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.<br /><br />
Just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&nbsp;»<br />
