<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.”</font>
<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      The Father is the one from whom all that exists comes. He himself, in Christ and through Christ, is the origin of all. Furthermore, He is in Himself His being, and He does not receive what He is from elsewhere… He is infinite because He is not in any one place, but all is in Him… He is always before time; time comes from Him. If your thought runs after Him and you believe you are reaching the limits of His being, you will always find Him, for as you ceaselessly progress towards Him, the goal you are heading for is always further away… Such is the truth of the mystery of God, such is the expression of the Father’s incomprehensible nature… To express Him, speech can only be silent; to fathom Him, thought remains inert; and to grasp Him, the intellect feels confined.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      And yet, this name of Father indicates His nature: He is solely Father. For He does not receive the fact of being Father from elsewhere, in the manner of men. He is the Eternal Unbegotten… He is known only by the Son, since “no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him,” and “no one knows the Son except the Father.” Both know each other, and this mutual knowledge is perfect. Therefore, since “no one knows the Father except the Son,” let us have no thought of the Father other than what the Son, who alone is “the faithful witness” (Rev 1:5), has revealed to us.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      It is better to think about what concerns the Father than to speak of Him. For all words are powerless to convey His perfections… We can only acknowledge His glory, have a certain idea of it, and try to define it with our imagination. But human language feels its inadequacy, and words do not explain reality as it is… Thus, however much one may acknowledge God, one must renounce naming Him: whatever words are used, they could not express God as He is, nor convey His greatness… We must believe in Him, try to understand Him, and adore Him; in doing so, we will speak of Him.<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">3:1-6, 9-12.</font>
In those days, Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock beyond the desert and came to the mountain of God, Horeb.<br /><br />
The angel of the Lord appeared to him in the flame of a burning bush. Moses looked: the bush was burning without being consumed.<br /><br />
Moses then said to himself, “I will turn aside to see this extraordinary sight: why the bush is not consumed?”<br /><br />
The Lord saw that he had turned aside to see, and God called to him from the midst of the bush, “Moses! Moses!” He said, “Here I am!”<br /><br />
God then said, “Do not come near here! Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground!”<br /><br />
And he declared, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Moses veiled his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.<br /><br />
The Lord said: “Now, the cry of the children of Israel has reached me, and I have seen the oppression the Egyptians inflict on them.<br /><br />
Now therefore, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh: you shall bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”<br /><br />
Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?”<br /><br />
God replied to him, “I am with you. And this shall be the sign that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought my people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">103(102):1-2, 3-4, 6-7.</font>
Bless the Lord, O my soul, <br /><br />and all that is within me, bless His holy name!<br /><br />Bless the Lord, O my soul, <br /><br />and forget not all His benefits!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Who forgives all your iniquities, <br /><br />who heals all your diseases;<br /><br />who redeems your life from destruction <br /><br />who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Lord executes righteousness <br /><br />and justice for all who are oppressed.<br /><br />He made known His ways to Moses, <br /><br />His acts to the children of Israel.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">11:25-27.</font>
At that time, Jesus spoke and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, and revealed them to the childlike.<br /><br />
Yes, Father, for this was your gracious will.<br /><br />
All things have been handed over to me by my Father; no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.”<br />
