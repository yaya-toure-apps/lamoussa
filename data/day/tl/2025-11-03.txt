<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"When you give a banquet, invite the poor"</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      Let us attend to the health of our neighbor with as much care as to our own, whether he be well or exhausted by illness. For "we are all one in the Lord" (Rom 12:5), rich or poor, slaves or free, healthy or sick. For all, there is but one head, the source of all — Christ (Col 1:18); what the members of the body are to one another, each of us is to each of our brothers. Therefore, we must neither neglect nor abandon those who have fallen before us into a state of weakness that awaits us all. Rather than rejoice in our good health, it is better to sympathize with the misfortunes of our poor brothers... They are in the image of God like us, and despite their apparent degradation, they have preserved the faithfulness of that image better than we have. In them, the inner person has put on the same Christ and they have received the same "pledge of the Spirit" (2 Cor 5:5); they have the same laws, the same commandments, the same covenants, the same assemblies, the same mysteries, the same hope. Christ died for them too, "He who takes away the sin of the world" (Jn 1:29). They share in the inheritance of heavenly life, they who have been deprived of many earthly goods here below. They are companions in Christ's sufferings, and they will be in His glory.<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Romans <font dir="ltr">11:29-36.</font>@@@@@God's free gifts and His call are irrevocable.<br /><br />
For formerly, you refused to believe in God, and now, through their refusal to believe, you have obtained mercy;<br /><br />
in the same way, now, it is they who have refused to believe, through the mercy you have obtained, but it is so that they, too, may obtain mercy.<br /><br />
For God has confined all men to unbelief so that He may have mercy on all.<br /><br />
Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how inscrutable His ways!<br /><br />
"Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?"<br /><br />
"Or who has given a gift to Him that he might be repaid?"<br /><br />
For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be glory forever! Amen.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">69(68):30-31, 33-34, 36, 37b.</font>@@@@@But I, afflicted and in pain,<br /><br />
may Your salvation, O God, lift me up.<br /><br />
And I will praise the name of God with a song;<br /><br />
I will magnify Him with thanksgiving.
The afflicted have seen and rejoiced;<br /><br />
"May your hearts revive, you who seek God!"<br /><br />
For the Lord listens to the needy,<br /><br />
and does not despise His imprisoned ones.
For God will save Zion<br /><br />
and rebuild the cities of Judah.<br /><br />
They will dwell there and possess it;<br /><br />
a heritage for the descendants of His servants,
and those who love His name will dwell in it.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">14:12-14.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus also said to the one who had invited Him, "When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends, or your brothers, or your relatives, or rich neighbors; otherwise, they may invite you back, and that will be your reward.<br /><br />
But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;<br /><br />
blessed will you be, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."<br />
