<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"My God, teach me to find my joy in praising You!"</font><font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            How much praise is an essential part of love; how much, consequently, it is an indispensable part of our duties towards God: this is easy to see… But there is a second reason why we owe God praise: it is that, to allow us to address it to Him, is on His part an incomparable favor.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            To allow someone to tell us, to repeat to us in all forms that they love us, is that not the greatest favor we can do for them? Is it not to tell them that their love pleases us, is agreeable to us, is it not almost to tell them that we love them too?... God allows us to stand at His feet, endlessly murmuring words of admiration and love: what grace! what goodness, what happiness!... But what ingratitude if we were to despise such a favor! It would be to despise it not to take advantage of it, and not only does God allow us this happiness of happinesses, but He commands it of us: He commands us to tell Him that we admire Him and that we love Him, and we do not respond to such a precious and sweet invitation? what ingratitude! what unworthiness! what rudeness! what monstrosity!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            My Lord and my God, teach me to find all my joy in praising You, that is, in endlessly repeating to You that You are infinitely perfect and that I love You infinitely: "Delectare in Domino et dabit tibi petitiones tuas" (Ps 36,4) You have said. Teach me to delight in You, in the sight of Your infinite beauties and the loving and incessant murmur, at Your feet, of Your praises!... Saint Magdalene, obtain for me the grace to praise Our Lord, our common Master, as He wishes me to do!<br />

Book of Genesis <font dir="ltr">18:1-10a.</font>In those days, at the oaks of Mamre, the Lord appeared to Abraham, who was sitting at the entrance of his tent. It was the hottest part of the day.<br /><br />
Abraham raised his eyes, and he saw three men standing near him. As soon as he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed down to the ground.<br /><br />
He said, "My lord, if I have found favor in your eyes, do not pass by your servant without stopping.<br /><br />
Please let a little water be brought, that you may wash your feet, and rest yourselves under this tree.<br /><br />
I will bring some food, and you can refresh yourselves before going on, since you have passed by your servant!" They replied, "Do as you have said."<br /><br />
Abraham hurried to Sara in his tent and said, "Quickly, get three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make loaves of bread."<br /><br />
Then Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who quickly prepared it.<br /><br />
He took curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set them before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.<br /><br />
They asked him, "Where is Sara, your wife?" He replied, "She is in the tent."<br /><br />
The traveler continued, "I will surely return to you about this time next year, and at that time, Sara, your wife, will have a son."<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">15(14):2-3a.3bc-4ab.4d-5.</font>The one who walks blamelessly,<br /><br />
who acts righteously<br /><br />
and speaks truth from the heart.<br /><br />
He puts a rein on his tongue.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He does no wrong to his brother<br /><br />
and casts no slur on his neighbor.<br /><br />
In his eyes, the reprobate is contemptible,<br /><br />
but he honors those who fear the Lord.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He does not retract his promise.<br /><br />
He lends his money without interest,<br /><br />
and accepts no bribe against the innocent.<br /><br />
Whoever does these things will never be shaken.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">10:38-42.</font>At that time, Jesus entered a village. A woman named Martha received him.<br /><br />
She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his word.<br /><br />
But Martha was distracted by her many tasks. So she came to him and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the serving alone? Tell her then to help me."<br /><br />
The Lord answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.<br /><br />
Only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the better part, and it will not be taken away from her."<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Colossians <font dir="ltr">1:24-28.</font>Brothers and sisters, I rejoice now in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the Church.<br /><br />
Of this Church I became a minister according to the divine commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,<br /><br />
the mystery that has been hidden for ages and generations but is now disclosed to the saints.<br /><br />
To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.<br /><br />
It is he whom we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ.<br />
