Book of Numbers <font dir="ltr">20:1-13.</font>@@@@@In the first month, the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin. They settled in Kadesh, and there Miriam died and was buried.<br /><br />
There was no water for the community, so they gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron.<br /><br />
The people quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the Lord!<br /><br />
Why did you bring the Lord’s community into this desert, that we and our livestock should die here?<br /><br />
Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!”<br /><br />
Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the Lord appeared to them.<br /><br />
The Lord said to Moses,<br /><br />
“Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the community together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for them and so give the community and their livestock a drink.”<br /><br />
So Moses took the staff from the Lord’s presence, just as he commanded him.<br /><br />
Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?”<br /><br />
Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.<br /><br />
But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the eyes of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them.”<br /><br />
These were the waters of Meribah (meaning ‘quarreling’), where the Israelites quarreled with the Lord and where he showed himself holy among them.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">95(94):1-2, 6-7ab, 7d-9a.</font>@@@@@Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord, <br /><br />
let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation!<br /><br />
Let us come before him with thanksgiving <br /><br />
and extol him with music and song.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Come, let us bow down in worship, <br /><br />
let us kneel before the Lord our Maker;<br /><br />
for he is our God;<br /><br />
and we are the people of his pasture.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Today, if only you would hear his voice,<br /><br />
“Do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, <br /><br />
as you did that day at Massah in the wilderness,<br /><br />
where your ancestors tested and tried me.”<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">16:13-23.</font>@@@@@At that time, when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”<br /><br />
They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”<br /><br />
“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”<br /><br />
Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”<br /><br />
Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.<br /><br />
And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.<br /><br />
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”<br /><br />
Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.<br /><br />
From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.<br /><br />
Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to you.”<br /><br />
Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”<br />
