<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">"Among those standing here, some will not taste death before seeing the kingdom of God."</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
    Our Lord Jesus Christ took Peter, James, and John up the mountain to show them the glory of his divinity and to make known to them that he was the Redeemer of Israel, as he had shown through the prophets. He also wanted to prevent them from being scandalized at the sight of the freely consented sufferings he was about to endure for us in his human nature. Indeed, they knew him as a man, but they did not know that he was God; they knew him as the son of Mary, a man dwelling with them in the world, but on the mountain he made known to them that he was the Son of God, and God himself.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    They had seen him eat and drink, work and rest, doze off and sleep, endure fear to the point of sweating drops of blood—all things that hardly seemed in harmony with his divine nature and appeared to suit only his humanity. That is why he took them up the mountain, so that the Father might call him his Son and show them that he was truly his Son and that he was God. He took them up the mountain and showed them his Kingdom before manifesting his sufferings, his power before his death, his glory before the outrages, and his honor before the ignominy. Thus, when he would be seized and crucified, his apostles would know that it had not been out of weakness but by consent and of his own free will, for the salvation of the world.<br />

Book of Daniel <font dir="ltr">7:9-10, 13-14.</font>@@@@@In the night vision, I, Daniel, looked: thrones were set up, and an Ancient of Days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was made of fiery flames, with wheels of burning fire.<br /><br />
A river of fire was flowing, gushing forth from before him. Thousands upon thousands served him; myriads upon myriads stood before him. The court sat, and the books were opened.<br /><br />
I looked, in the night visions, and I saw one like a Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven; he approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.<br /><br />
And to him was given dominion, glory, and kingship; all peoples, nations, and languages served him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingship is one that will not be destroyed.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">97(96):1-2, 4-5, 6, 9.</font>@@@@@The Lord is king! Let the earth rejoice! <br /><br />
Let the many islands be glad!<br /><br />
Clouds and thick darkness surround him; <br /><br />
righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When his lightning flashes lit up the world, <br /><br />
the earth saw and trembled.<br /><br />
The mountains melted like wax before the Lord, <br /><br />
before the Lord of all the earth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The heavens proclaim his righteousness, <br /><br />
and all peoples see his glory.<br /><br />
You, Lord, are the Most High over all the earth: <br /><br />
you are exalted far above all gods.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">9:28b-36.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.<br /><br />
As he prayed, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white.<br /><br />
And behold, two men were talking with him: Moses and Elijah,<br /><br />
who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.<br /><br />
Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but when they awoke fully, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.<br /><br />
As these were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He did not know what he was saying.<br /><br />
While he was still speaking, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud.<br /><br />
And from the cloud a voice came, saying, "This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!"<br /><br />
When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one anything of what they had seen.<br />
