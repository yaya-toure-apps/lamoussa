<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Behold my servant”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      The mystery of our salvation is so vast, so profound, so admirable that the angels themselves earnestly desire to look into it (1 Pt 1:12)... As Christ was God in his nature, the true Word of God the Father (Jn 1:1), of the same nature as the Father and co-eternal with him, and as he shone in the highest of his glory “in the form and likeness of God,” “he did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,” and being born of the Blessed Mary. “And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross” (Phil 2:6-8).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      He humbles himself towards our lowliness, he who gave all people his own fullness. He humbles himself for us, not by compulsion, but of his own free will. For us, he takes the condition of a slave, he who was freedom itself. He becomes one of us, he who was elevated above all creation. He submits to death, he who gives life to the world... He becomes subject to the Law like us (Gal 4:4), he who, as God, transcends the Law. He becomes a man among others, subject to birth. He takes a beginning, he who precedes all centuries and all ages: moreover, he who is the creator and origin of time... He who took flesh from Mary...is of the same nature as us, is made of our own substance, taking on the offspring of Abraham. But, at the same time, he is, on the divine plane, of the same nature as God his Father.  <br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">12:37-42.</font>@@@@@In those days, the sons of Israel set out from the city of Rameses towards Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.<br /><br />
A mixed multitude accompanied them, along with an immense flock of sheep and cattle.<br /><br />
They baked unleavened cakes with the dough they had brought out of Egypt and which had not risen; for they had been driven out of Egypt without having had time to prepare provisions for themselves.<br /><br />
The sojourn of the sons of Israel in Egypt had lasted four hundred and thirty years.<br /><br />
And it was at the end of four hundred and thirty years, on that very day, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.<br /><br />
It was a night of vigil for the Lord, when he brought the sons of Israel out of Egypt; this must be for them, from generation to generation, a night of vigil in honor of the Lord.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">136(135):1, 23-24, 10-12, 13-15.</font>@@@@@Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, <br /><br />
for his love endures forever!<br /><br />
He remembered us in our low estate, <br /><br />
for his love endures forever!<br /><br />
and freed us from the hand of our oppressors, <br /><br />
for his love endures forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, <br /><br />
for his love endures forever!<br /><br />
and brought Israel out from among them, <br /><br />
for his love endures forever!<br /><br />
with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, <br /><br />
for his love endures forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Who divided the Red Sea into two parts, <br /><br />
for his love endures forever!<br /><br />
and made Israel pass through its midst, <br /><br />
for his love endures forever!<br /><br />
but hurled Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea, <br /><br />
for his love endures forever!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">12:14-21.</font>@@@@@At that time, when the Pharisees went out of the synagogue, they conspired against Jesus to see how they might destroy him.<br /><br />
Jesus, being aware of this, withdrew from there; and many people followed him, and he healed them all.<br /><br />
But he strictly charged them not to make him known,<br /><br />
that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:<br /><br />
“Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.<br /><br />
He will not quarrel or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.<br /><br />
A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he brings justice to victory.<br /><br />
And in his name the Gentiles will hope.”<br />
