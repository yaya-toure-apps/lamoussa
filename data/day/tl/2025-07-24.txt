<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      A felled tree, even cut at the base, sprouts again and reblooms; and a felled man will not live again? Harvested seeds rest, sleep in granaries and revive in spring; and man, harvested, cast into the granaries of death, will he not live again? A vine bud, a cut and transplanted branch, revives and bears fruit; and man, for whom all was created, once fallen, will he not be able to rise again?...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     Contemplate then what is happening around you. Meditate on the picture of this vast universe. I sow wheat or any other seed; it falls and dies, it decays and can no longer serve as food for man. But from its decay it is reborn, it rises, it multiplies. Now, for whom was it created? Is it not for our use? It is not for themselves that all these seeds came out of nothingness. So what was created for us dies and is reborn, and we, for whom this wonder operates every day, would our death be without awakening?<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">19:1-2, 9-11, 16-20ab.</font>@@@@@In the third month after the Israelites had gone out of Egypt, on that very day, they came to the Desert of Sinai.<br /><br />
After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.<br /><br />
The Lord said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always have confidence in you.” Then Moses told the Lord what the people had said.<br /><br />
And the Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes,<br /><br />
and be ready for the third day, because on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.”<br /><br />
On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.<br /><br />
Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.<br /><br />
Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently.<br /><br />
The trumpet blast grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke, and the voice of God answered him.<br /><br />
The Lord descended to the top of Mount Sinai,<br /><br />
and called Moses to the top of the mountain.<br />

Book of Daniel <font dir="ltr">3:52-56.</font>@@@@@Blessed are you, Lord, God of our fathers: <br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever! <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed be the most holy name of your glory: <br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are you in your holy temple of glory: <br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom: <br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are you, who search the depths: <br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever! <br /><br />
<br /><br />
You who sit above the Cherubim: <br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are you in the firmament, in heaven, <br /><br />
To you be praise and glory forever!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:10-17.</font>@@@@@At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”<br /><br />
He replied, “Because the knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.<br /><br />
Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.<br /><br />
This is why I speak to them in parables: Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.<br /><br />
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: ‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.<br /><br />
For this people’s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.’<br /><br />
But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear!<br /><br />
Truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”<br />
