Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">32:15-24, 30-34.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses came down from the mountain, carrying the two tablets of the Testimony, tablets written on both sides;<br /><br />
they were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on these tablets.<br /><br />
Joshua heard the noise and uproar of the people and said to Moses, "There is the sound of war in the camp."<br /><br />
Moses replied, "These sounds are not the cries of victory nor of defeat; what I hear are songs answering one another."<br /><br />
As he approached the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. He blazed with anger, threw down the tablets he was carrying, and broke them at the foot of the mountain.<br /><br />
He seized the calf they had made, burned it, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the surface of the water. And he made the Israelites drink that water.<br /><br />
Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have led them into such great sin?"<br /><br />
Aaron replied, "May my lord not be angry! You know well that this people is prone to evil!<br /><br />
They were the ones who said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'<br /><br />
I told them, 'Whoever has gold, let them take it off.' They gave it to me, I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."<br /><br />
The next day, Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the Lord. Perhaps I can obtain remission for your sin."<br /><br />
Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Alas! This people has committed a great sin: they have made themselves gods of gold.<br /><br />
Oh, if only you would forgive their sin! But if not, then blot me out of your book that you have written."<br /><br />
The Lord replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me is the one I will blot out of my book."<br /><br />
Go now, lead the people to the place I have indicated to you, and my angel will go before you. On the day I intervene, I will punish them for their sin."<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:31-35.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus proposed another parable to the crowds: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.<br /><br />
It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown, it is larger than other garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and make their nests in its branches."<br /><br />
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all the dough was leavened."<br /><br />
Jesus spoke all this to the crowds in parables, and he told them nothing without a parable,<br /><br />
thus fulfilling what was spoken through the prophet: 'I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.'"<br />
