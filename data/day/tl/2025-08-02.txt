<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you” (Mt 11:10; Mal 3:1)</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            “&amp;nbsp;The memory of the righteous is accompanied by praise&amp;nbsp;” (Prov 10:7), but for you, the Forerunner, the Lord’s testimony suffices. Truly, you showed yourself to be “&amp;nbsp;the greatest of all the prophets&amp;nbsp;” (Mt 11:9)&amp;nbsp;; therefore you were worthy to baptize in the waters Him whom they had announced. And having striven on earth for the truth, full of joy, you announced even in the abode of the dead God manifested in the flesh, He who takes away the sin of the world (1 Tim 3:16; Jn 1:29) and who grants us the grace of salvation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            By the will of God, you came forth from a barren woman, you broke the bonds of your father's tongue (Lk 1:7,64), you showed forth the Sun, who enlightened you, you the morning star. In the desert, you preached to the peoples the Creator, the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world (Jn 1:29). In your zeal you rebuked the king and your glorious head was beheaded, you the illustrious Forerunner, truly worthy of our hymns.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Intercede with Christ our God, that He may grant forgiveness of their sins to those who celebrate your sacred memory with all their heart.<br />

Book of Leviticus <font dir="ltr">25:1,8-17.</font>@@@@@The Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying:<br /><br />
“You shall count seven weeks of years, that is, seven times seven years, amounting to forty-nine years.<br /><br />
On the tenth day of the seventh month, on the Day of Atonement, you shall make proclamation with the trumpet; on that day, throughout all your land, you shall sound the trumpet.<br /><br />
You shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his clan.<br /><br />
That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you: you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of itself, nor gather grapes from the undressed vines.<br /><br />
The Jubilee shall be holy to you; you may eat of what the field produces.<br /><br />
In this year of jubilee, each of you shall return to his property.<br /><br />
If, in the interval, you must sell or buy, you shall not wrong your compatriot.<br /><br />
When you buy from your compatriot, you shall calculate according to the number of years since the jubilee; he who sells shall calculate according to the number of remaining years.<br /><br />
The more years remain, the more you shall increase the price; the fewer years remain, the more you shall reduce the price, for the sale concerns only the number of harvests.<br /><br />
You shall not wrong your compatriot, but you shall fear your God. I am the Lord your God.”<br />

and make his face shine upon us; <br /><br />
that your way may be known on earth, <br /><br />
your salvation, among all nations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, <br /><br />
for you govern the world with justice; <br /><br />
you govern the peoples with uprightness, <br /><br />
on earth, you lead the nations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The earth has yielded its increase; <br /><br />
God, our God, blesses us.<br /><br />
May God bless us, <br /><br />
and may the whole earth adore him!<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">14:1-12.</font>@@@@@At that time, Herod, who was in power in Galilee, heard the report concerning Jesus,<br /><br />
and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and therefore these miraculous powers are at work in him.”<br /><br />
For Herod had seized John, bound him, and put him in prison. This was because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.<br /><br />
For John had said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”<br /><br />
Herod wanted to put him to death, but he feared the crowd, because they held him to be a prophet.<br /><br />
But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and she pleased Herod,<br /><br />
so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.<br /><br />
Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”<br /><br />
The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oath and his guests, he commanded it to be given.<br /><br />
He sent and had John beheaded in the prison.<br /><br />
And his head was brought on a platter and given to the young woman, and she brought it to her mother.<br /><br />
John’s disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.<br />
