      Despite the real organic unity of head and body, the Church stands beside Christ as an independent person. As the Son of the Eternal Father, Christ lived before the beginning of time and before all human existence. Then, through the act of creation, humanity lived before Christ took on its nature and integrated himself into it. But by his Incarnation, he brought it his divine life&amp;nbsp;; by his work of redemption, he made it capable of receiving grace, so much so that he recreated it a second time... The Church is redeemed humanity, newly created from the very substance of Christ. 
      The primitive cell of this redeemed humanity is Mary&amp;nbsp;; it is in her that purification and sanctification by Christ were accomplished for the first time, it is she who was first filled with the Holy Spirit. Before the Son of God was born of the Blessed Virgin, he created this Virgin full of grace and, in her and with her, the Church...
      Every soul purified by baptism and elevated to the state of grace is, by that very fact, created by Christ and born for Christ. But it is created in the Church and it is born through the Church... Thus, the Church is the mother of all to whom redemption is addressed. She is so by her intimate union with Christ, and because she stands by his side as the Bride of Christ to collaborate in his work of redemption.<br />

Book of Ezra <font dir="ltr">6:7-8, 12b, 14-20.</font>@@@@@In those days, Darius, the king of Persia, wrote to the authorities of the province west of the Euphrates: "Let the governor of Judah and the elders of the Jews work on this House of God; they are to rebuild it on its site.<br /><br />
Here are my orders concerning your conduct toward the elders of the Jews for the rebuilding of this House of God: the expenses of these men are to be reimbursed to them, exactly and without interruption, from the royal funds, that is, from the tax of the province.<br /><br />
I, Darius, have given this order. Let it be strictly carried out!"<br /><br />
The elders of the Jews continued the construction work with success, encouraged by the word of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, son of Iddo. They completed the construction according to the order of the God of Israel, according to the decrees of Cyrus and Darius.<br /><br />
The House of God was completed on the third day of the month called Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius.<br /><br />
The sons of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the repatriates joyfully celebrated the dedication of this House of God.<br /><br />
For this dedication, they sacrificed one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.<br /><br />
Then they installed the priests according to their divisions, and the Levites according to their groups, for the service of God in Jerusalem, according to the prescriptions of the book of Moses.<br /><br />
The repatriates celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.<br /><br />
All the priests and all the Levites, without exception, had purified themselves: all were pure. So they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the repatriates, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">122 (121):1-2, 3-4a, 4b-5.</font>@@@@@What joy when they said to me: <br /><br />
"We will go to the house of the Lord!"<br /><br />
Now our journey ends <br /><br />
before your gates, Jerusalem!
Jerusalem, here you are within your walls: <br /><br />
a city where all together is one!<br /><br />
It is there that the tribes ascend,<br /><br />
the tribes of the Lord.
It is there the seat of justice, <br /><br />
the seat of the house of David.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke <font dir="ltr">8:19-21.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus' mother and brothers came to him, but they could not get to him because of the crowd.<br /><br />
He was told, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you."<br /><br />
He replied to them, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and put it into practice."<br />
