<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      The Apostle Paul says that creation itself awaits the revelation of the children of God (Rom 8:19). This creation is now, against its will, subjected to futility;&nbsp;but it is in hope. For it hopes that Christ will help it by His grace to be freed from the slavery of inevitable decay, and to receive the glorious freedom of the children of God. Thus there will be a single freedom, for creation and for the children of God, when their glory is revealed. But now, as long as this revelation is still awaited, all creation groans as it waits to share in the glory of our adoption and our redemption (v. 22)...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      It is clear that the creatures groaning as they await the adoption of sons have within them the first fruits of the Spirit (v. 9ff). This adoption of sons is the redemption of the whole body, when it, as an adopted child of God, will see face to face that eternal and divine good. There is already filial adoption in the Church of the Lord when the Spirit in us cries out:&nbsp;“Abba, Father” (v. 15). But this adoption will be perfect when those who are admitted to see the face of God will all rise in immortality, honor, and glory. Then the human condition will truly consider itself redeemed. That is why the Apostle Paul dares to say:&nbsp;“We have been saved in hope” (v. 24). Indeed, hope saves, like faith, of which it is said:&nbsp;“Your faith has saved you” (Mk 5:34).<br />

Book of Deuteronomy <font dir="ltr">10:12-22.</font>
Moses said to the people:<br /><br />
“Now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you? To fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, to love the Lord your God, to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,<br /><br />
to keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord that I am giving you today for your good.<br /><br />
To the Lord your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it.<br /><br />
Yet, it was only to your fathers that the Lord your God was bound in love. After them, from all peoples, it was their descendants He chose, which He still does today with you.<br /><br />
Practice circumcision of the heart, and be no longer stiff-necked,<br /><br />
for the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribe.<br /><br />
He gives justice to the orphan and the widow, and loves the immigrant, giving him food and clothing.<br /><br />
Therefore love the immigrant, for you yourselves were immigrants in the land of Egypt.<br /><br />
You shall fear the Lord your God, you shall serve Him, you shall cling to Him, and by His name you shall swear.<br /><br />
He is your God; it is He whom you must praise: He has done for you these great and awesome things that you have seen with your own eyes.<br /><br />
When your fathers arrived in Egypt, they were only seventy; but now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">147:12-13.14-15.19-20.</font>
Glorify the Lord, O Jerusalem!<br /><br />
Praise your God, O Zion!<br /><br />
For He has strengthened the bars of your gates, <br /><br />
He has blessed your children within you.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He makes peace in your borders, <br /><br />
He fills you with the finest of wheat.<br /><br />
He sends out His command to the earth; <br /><br />
His word runs swiftly.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He declares His word to Jacob, <br /><br />
His statutes and His ordinances to Israel.<br /><br />
He has not dealt thus with any other nation; <br /><br />
nor have they known His ordinances.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">17:22-27.</font>
At that time, as Jesus and the disciples were gathered in Galilee, He said to them: “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men;<br /><br />
they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised.” And they were deeply saddened.<br /><br />
As they arrived in Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and said, “Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?”<br /><br />
He replied, “Yes.” When Peter entered the house, Jesus spoke to him first: “What is your opinion, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes or tribute? From their sons, or from others?”<br /><br />
Peter answered Him, “From others.” And Jesus replied, “Therefore the sons are free.<br /><br />
But so that we may not offend them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a four-drachma coin. Take that and give it to them for Me and for yourself.”<br />
