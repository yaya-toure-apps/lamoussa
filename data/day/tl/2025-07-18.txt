<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
    Lord God, you who have filled us with everything, give us peace (Is 26:12), the peace of rest, the peace of the sabbath, the sabbath that has no evening. For this beautiful order of things that you have created and which are “very good” (Gen 1:31) will pass when it has reached the end of its destiny. Yes, they had their morning, they will have their evening. But the seventh day has no evening, no sunset, since you sanctified it to last forever. At the end of your “very good” works, which you nevertheless performed in rest, you rested on the seventh day; this is to tell us through your book that at the end of our works, which are very good because it is you who gave them to us (Is 26:12), we too will rest in you on the sabbath of eternal life. Then you will rest in us just as today you act in us; thus this rest that we will taste will be yours, just as the works we do are yours.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    You, Lord, are always at work and are always at rest… For us, there comes a moment when we are moved to act for good, after our heart has conceived it from your Spirit, whereas before we were moved to do evil when we abandoned you. You, uniquely good God, have never ceased to do good. Some of our works are good, by your grace it is true, but they are not eternal; after them, we hope to rest in your ineffable sanctification. But you, Goodness who needs no other good, you are always at rest, because your rest is yourself.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    Who among men can give understanding of all this to man? What angel will give it to angels? What angel to man? It is from you that it must be asked, in you that it must be sought, at your door that one must knock. And thus, yes, thus one will receive, thus one will find, thus the door will be opened (Mt 7:8).<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">11:10.12:1-14.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses and Aaron had performed all sorts of wonders before Pharaoh; but the Lord had made Pharaoh obstinate; and he did not let the sons of Israel leave his country.<br /><br />
In the land of Egypt, the Lord said to Moses and his brother Aaron:<br /><br />
“This month shall be for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you.<br /><br />
Speak thus to all the community of Israel: on the tenth of this month, let each family take a lamb, a lamb per household.<br /><br />
If the household is too small for a lamb, it shall take it with its nearest neighbor, according to the number of persons. You shall choose the lamb according to what each can eat.<br /><br />
It shall be an unblemished animal, a male, one year old. You shall take a lamb or a young goat.<br /><br />
You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the month. In the entire assembly of the community of Israel, it shall be sacrificed at sunset.<br /><br />
They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where they eat it.<br /><br />
They shall eat its flesh that night, roasted over the fire, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.<br /><br />
You shall not eat any of it half cooked or boiled; everything shall be roasted over the fire, including its head, its shanks, and its entrails.<br /><br />
You shall not keep anything of it until the morning; what remains until the morning, you shall destroy by burning it.<br /><br />
You shall eat in this manner: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You shall eat in haste: it is the Passover of the Lord.<br /><br />
I will pass through the land of Egypt that night; I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute my judgments: I am the Lord.<br /><br />
The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you; no plague will fall on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.<br /><br />
This day shall be a memorial for you. You shall celebrate it as a pilgrimage feast for the Lord. It is a perpetual decree: from age to age you shall celebrate it.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">116 (115), 12-13.15-16ac.17-18.</font>@@@@@How shall I repay the Lord <br /><br />
for all the good he has done for me?<br /><br />
I will lift up the cup of salvation, <br /><br />
and call on the name of the Lord.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Precious in the sight of the Lord <br /><br />
is the death of his faithful ones.<br /><br />
Am I not, Lord, your servant,<br /><br />
I, whom you freed from my bonds?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, <br /><br />
and call on the name of the Lord.<br /><br />
I will fulfill my vows to the Lord, <br /><br />
yes, before all his people.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">12:1-8.</font>@@@@@At that time, on a Sabbath day, Jesus happened to be passing through the grainfields; his disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them.<br /><br />
Seeing this, the Pharisees said to him, “Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!”<br /><br />
But he said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?<br /><br />
He entered the house of God and they ate the showbread, which neither he nor those with him had a right to eat, but only the priests.<br /><br />
Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless?<br /><br />
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.<br /><br />
If you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’<br /><br />
you would not have condemned the blameless. For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”<br />
