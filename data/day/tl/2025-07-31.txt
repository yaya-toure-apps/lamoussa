<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">The Vigilant Asceticism of the Righteous</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            “&nbsp;My breath will be exhausted.&nbsp;” (Job 17:1 Vg) Breath is exhausted in fear of judgment, because the closer the soul of the elect feels to the supreme judgment, the more it trembles with dread in its examination of conscience, and if it comes to discover within itself any carnal thoughts, it consumes them in the fire of penance. (…) The elect one beats his breast with all the more insight as he rigorously awaits the judge, already very near.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Hence it is that the elect believe their end is always near. For if the soul of the reprobate often behaves wickedly, it is because it judges itself to have a long time to live in this world. Thus the breath of the righteous withers and that of the unrighteous is strengthened. Indeed, by the very fact that it swells with pride, it does not know the fading of its breath. But, by considering the brevity of his life, the righteous turns away from the sins of pride and impurity. Hence this addition:&nbsp;“My days will be shortened, and only the grave remains for me.” He who considers what he will be in death never acts but with fear;&nbsp;and already, by no longer being alive, so to speak, in his own eyes, he lives in all truth in the eyes of him who formed him. (…)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            It is in this vigilant asceticism that the righteous escapes the snares of sin. Hence this word of Scripture:&nbsp;“In all your works remember your last end, and you will never sin.” (Sirach 7:40 Vg)<br />

Book of Exodus <font dir="ltr">40:16-21, 34-38.</font>@@@@@In those days, Moses did everything the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
The dwelling of God was erected in the second year after the Exodus from Egypt, on the first day of the first month.<br /><br />
Moses thus erected the Dwelling: he set up its bases, its frames and its crossbars, and he set up its pillars.<br /><br />
Over the Dwelling, he spread the Tent and covered it, as the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
He took the Testimony and put it into the ark. He put the poles into the ark and covered it with the golden plate called the propitiatory.<br /><br />
He brought the ark into the Dwelling, and put up the curtain to veil the ark of the Testimony, as the Lord had commanded him.<br /><br />
The cloud covered the tent of Meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the Dwelling.<br /><br />
Moses could not enter the tent of Meeting, for the cloud remained there and the glory of the Lord filled the Dwelling.<br /><br />
At each stage, when the cloud rose and left the Dwelling, the sons of Israel broke camp.<br /><br />
If the cloud did not rise, they camped until the day it rose.<br /><br />
By day, the cloud of the Lord rested on the Dwelling, and by night, a fire shone in the cloud in the sight of all Israel. And thus it was at all their stages.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">84(83):3, 4, 5-6, 11.</font>@@@@@My soul yearns and pines for <br /><br />
the courts of the Lord;<br /><br />
my heart and my flesh cry out <br /><br />
for the living God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Even the sparrow finds a home,<br /><br />
and the swallow a nest for its young:<br /><br />
your altars, O Lord of hosts,<br /><br />
my King and my God!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Blessed are those who dwell in your house;<br /><br />
they will praise you still!<br /><br />
Blessed are the men whose strength is in you;<br /><br />
whose hearts are set on pilgrimage!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For a day in your courts<br /><br />
is better than a thousand elsewhere.<br /><br />
I would rather be a doorkeeper<br /><br />
in the house of my God,<br /><br />
than dwell in the tents of wickedness.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:47-53.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus said to the crowds: “The kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea, which gathers fish of every kind.<br /><br />
When it is full, they pull it ashore, sit down, and put the good into baskets, but throw out the bad.<br /><br />
So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come out and separate the wicked from the righteous,<br /><br />
and throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”<br /><br />
“Have you understood all this?” They answered, “Yes.”<br /><br />
He said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”<br /><br />
When Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there.<br />
