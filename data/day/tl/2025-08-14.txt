"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive also" (Mt 5:12)

Every person is God's debtor, and has their brother as a debtor. Indeed, who would be the one who owes nothing to God, if not one in whom no sin can be found? And who does not have a brother as a debtor, if not one whom no one has offended? Do you think you can find a single person in humankind who is not indebted to their brother for some fault?

Every person, then, is a debtor and has debtors. This is why the just God gives you a rule of conduct regarding your debtor, which He follows regarding His own. For there are two works of mercy that can set us free, and which the Lord himself teaches us in a few words in His Gospel: "Forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you" (Lk 6:37ff) (…): these are indulgence and goodness.

Here is what He teaches us about forgiveness: you want your sins to be forgiven, and you also have sins to forgive others. The same applies to charity: a beggar asks you for alms, and you are God's beggar, for we are all God's beggars when we pray to Him. We stand, or rather prostrate ourselves, before our Father's door, before His great wealth. We implore Him with groans, desiring to receive something from Him: and that something is God Himself. What does the beggar ask of you? Bread. And you, what do you ask of God if not Christ who said: "I am the living bread that came down from heaven" (Jn 6:51). You want to be forgiven? "Forgive, and you will be forgiven." You want to receive? "Give, and it will be given to you."

Book of Joshua 3:7-10a, 11, 13-17.
In those days, the Lord said to Joshua: “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses.

You are to command the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you are to stand still in the Jordan.’ ”

Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God.

This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites:

See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will cross the Jordan ahead of you.

As soon as the priests who carry the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing from upstream will be cut off and will stand up in a heap.”

So when the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.

Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge,

the water flowing upstream was cut off and stood up in a heap a great distance away, at Adam, a town beside Zarethan; and the water flowing toward the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.

The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel passed over on dry ground, until the whole nation had completed crossing the Jordan.

Psalm 114 (113A):1-2, 3-4, 5-6.
When Israel came out of Egypt, 

and Jacob, from a people of foreign tongue,

Judah became God’s sanctuary, 

Israel his dominion.

The sea looked and fled, 

the Jordan turned back.

The mountains leaped like rams, 

the hills like lambs.

Why was it, sea, that you fled? Jordan, 

why did you turn back?

Mountains, why did you leap like rams? 

Hills, like lambs?

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew 18:21-35; 19:1.
At that time, Peter approached Jesus and asked him, “Lord, if my brother sins against me, how many times must I forgive him? As many as seven times?”

Jesus answered, “I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times.

That is why the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.

As he began the reckoning, a man who owed him ten thousand talents (that is, sixty million silver coins) was brought to him.

Since he had no means of paying it back, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife, children, and all his possessions, in payment of the debt.

At that, the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.’

Moved with compassion, the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan.

But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and started to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back what you owe!’

His fellow servant fell to his knees and pleaded with him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.’

But he refused. Instead, he had him thrown into prison until he could pay back what he owed.

When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had taken place.

Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.

Should you not have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?’

In anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back all that he owed.

So will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from the heart.”

When Jesus had finished this discourse, he departed from Galilee and came to the district of Judea across the Jordan.
