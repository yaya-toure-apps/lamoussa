On Trust and Perseverance in Prayer@@@@@<br />
      As long as we have not acquired true prayer, we resemble those who begin to teach children to walk.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Strive to elevate your thought, or rather to enclose it within the words of prayer; and if, because of its infantile state, it weakens and falls, bring it back again. Instability is characteristic of the intellect, but God has the power to make it stable. If you persevere tirelessly in this struggle, He who set boundaries for the sea of the intellect will also come to you and say to it during your prayer: “Thus far shall you come, and no farther” (Job 38:11). The spirit cannot be enchained; but where the Creator of the spirit is, all is subject to Him.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Faith gives wings to prayer; without it, indeed, we cannot fly up to heaven.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Book of Genesis 18:20-32.@@@@@In those days, Abraham’s three visitors were about to depart for Sodom.<br /><br />
Then the LORD said, “How great is the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah! How heavy is their sin!<br /><br />
I will go down to see whether their conduct is as great as the outcry against them that has reached me; if not, I will know.”<br /><br />
The men set out from there and looked toward Sodom. Abraham, however, remained standing before the LORD.<br /><br />
Abraham drew near and said, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?<br /><br />
Perhaps there are fifty righteous people in the city. Will you really sweep them away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?<br /><br />
Far be it from you to do such a thing! To slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked, far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”<br /><br />
The LORD said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous people within the city, then for their sake I will spare the whole place.”<br /><br />
Abraham answered, “See, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord, though I am but dust and ashes.<br /><br />
Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?” He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”<br /><br />
Again he spoke to him, “Suppose forty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”<br /><br />
Then he said, “Oh, do not let the Lord be angry if I speak again. Suppose thirty are found there.” He answered, “I will not do it, for the sake of thirty.”<br /><br />
He said, “See now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”<br /><br />
Then he said, “Oh, do not let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. Suppose ten are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”<br />

Psalm 138(137),1-2a.2bc-3.6-7ab.7c-8.@@@@@I thank you, LORD, with all my heart;<br /><br />
you have heard the words of my mouth.<br /><br />
In the presence of the angels I will sing your praise;<br /><br />
I will bow down toward your holy temple.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and faithfulness;<br /><br />
for you have exalted above all else your name and your promise.<br /><br />
On the day I called, you answered me;<br /><br />
you increased strength within me.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Though the LORD is high, he looks on the lowly;<br /><br />
the haughty he knows from afar.<br /><br />
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve me;<br /><br />
you stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Your right hand delivers me.<br /><br />
The LORD will fulfill his purpose for me.<br /><br />
LORD, your steadfast love endures forever;<br /><br />
do not forsake the work of your hands.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke 11:1-13.@@@@@He was praying in a certain place, and after he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.”<br /><br />
He said to them, “When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come.<br /><br />
Give us each day our daily bread.<br /><br />
And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us to the time of trial.”<br /><br />
And he said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;<br /><br />
for a friend of mine has arrived, and I have nothing to set before him.’<br /><br />
And he answers from within, ‘Do not bother me; the door has already been locked, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.’<br /><br />
I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you anything because he is your friend, yet because of your shameless persistence he will get up and give you whatever you need.<br /><br />
“So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.<br /><br />
For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.<br /><br />
Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for a fish, will give a snake instead of a fish?<br /><br />
Or if the child asks for an egg, will give a scorpion?<br /><br />
If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”<br />

Letter of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:12-14.@@@@@Brothers and sisters, you were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.<br /><br />
And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, when he forgave us all our trespasses,<br /><br />
erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross.<br />
