<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr">“Is he not the carpenter’s son?”</font>@@@@@<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
            The communion of life between Joseph and Jesus leads us to consider the mystery of the Incarnation from the perspective of Christ's humanity, an effective instrument of divinity for the sanctification of mankind: “By virtue of His divinity, the human actions of Christ were salvific for us, producing grace within us both by merit and by a certain efficacy” (St. Thomas Aquinas).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Among these actions, the evangelists prioritize those concerning the Paschal mystery, but they do not fail to emphasize the importance of physical contact with Jesus... Apostolic testimony did not omit to describe the birth of Jesus, the circumcision, the Presentation in the Temple, the flight into Egypt, and the hidden life in Nazareth, and this due to the mystery of grace contained in such gestures, all salvific, because they partake of the same source of love: the divinity of Christ. If this love, through His humanity, radiated upon all mankind, its primary beneficiaries were evidently those whom divine will had placed in His closest intimacy: Mary, His mother, and Joseph, His putative father.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            Since Joseph’s paternal love could not but influence Jesus’ filial love, and reciprocally, Jesus’ filial love could not but influence Joseph’s paternal love, how can we come to know this utterly singular relationship in depth? Souls most sensitive to the impulses of divine love rightly see in Joseph a luminous example of interior life.<br />

Book of Leviticus <font dir="ltr">23:1, 4-11, 15-16, 27, 34b-37.</font>@@@@@The Lord spoke to Moses and said:<br /><br />
These are the Lord’s appointed feasts, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times.<br /><br />
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, is the Lord’s Passover.<br /><br />
On the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the Lord; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.<br /><br />
On the first day you shall have a sacred assembly; you shall do no customary work.<br /><br />
For seven days you shall present food offerings to the Lord. On the seventh day you shall have a sacred assembly; you shall do no customary work.”<br /><br />
The Lord spoke to Moses and said:<br /><br />
“Speak to the sons of Israel. Tell them: When you enter the land I am giving you and you reap its harvest, you shall bring the first sheaf of your harvest to the priest.<br /><br />
He shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted on your behalf; the priest shall wave it on the day after the Sabbath.<br /><br />
From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, you shall count seven full weeks.<br /><br />
Until the day after the seventh Sabbath you shall count fifty days, and then you shall present a new grain offering to the Lord.<br /><br />
The tenth day of the seventh month is the Day of Atonement. You shall hold a sacred assembly, and you shall humble yourselves, and present a food offering to the Lord.<br /><br />
On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, for seven days, is the Feast of Tabernacles to the Lord.<br /><br />
On the first day you shall have a sacred assembly; you shall do no customary work.<br /><br />
For seven days you shall present food offerings to the Lord. On the eighth day you shall have a sacred assembly and present a food offering to the Lord; it is a closing assembly; you shall do no customary work.<br /><br />
These are the appointed feasts of the Lord, which you shall proclaim as sacred assemblies, for presenting food offerings to the Lord—burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings—each on its designated day.”<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">81(80):3-4, 5-6ab, 10-11ab.</font>@@@@@Play music, strike the tambourine, <br /><br />
the sweet lyre and the harp.<br /><br />
Sound the horn for the new moon, <br /><br />
when our feast day comes.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This is a statute for Israel, <br /><br />
an ordinance of the God of Jacob;<br /><br />
He made it a decree for Joseph<br /><br />
when he went out against the land of Egypt.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
“You shall have no other gods among you, <br /><br />
nor shall you worship any foreign god.<br /><br />
I am the Lord your God,<br /><br />
who brought you up from the land of Egypt!”<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew <font dir="ltr">13:54-58.</font>@@@@@At that time, Jesus came to his hometown and taught the people in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?<br /><br />
Is he not the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother named Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Jude?<br /><br />
And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?”<br /><br />
And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.”<br /><br />
And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.<br />
