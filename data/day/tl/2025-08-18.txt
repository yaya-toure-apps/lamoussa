<font style="align-text:left" dir="ltr"><br />
      This young man clearly feels that while nothing is lacking in his virtue, life itself still eludes him. This is why he comes to ask for it from the only one who can grant it. He is sure he is in conformity with the Law; yet he implores the Son of God. From one faith he passes to another. The moorings of the Law poorly protected him from the rolling; uneasy, he leaves this dangerous anchorage and comes to cast anchor in the Savior's port.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      Jesus does not reproach him for having failed any article of the Law, but he begins to love him (Mk 10:21), moved by this diligent application. However, he still declares him imperfect… : he is a good worker of the Law, but lazy for eternal life. This is already good, no doubt; "the holy Law" is like a tutor (Rom 7:12; Gal 3:24) who instructs through fear and leads towards Jesus' sublime commandments and towards his grace. "Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes" (Rom 10:4). He is not a slave who makes slaves, but he gives the quality of sons, brothers, co-heirs, to all who accomplish the Father's will (Rom 8:17; Mt 12:50)…<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      This phrase "if you wish" admirably shows the young man's freedom; it is up to him to choose, he is master of his decision. But it is God who gives, because he is the Lord. He gives to all those who desire and apply all their ardor and pray, so that salvation may be their own choice. An enemy of violence, God compels no one, but he extends grace to those who seek it, offers it to those who ask for it, opens to those who knock (Mt 7:7).<br />

In those days, the Israelites did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord, and they served the Baals.<br /><br />
They abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they followed other gods among those of the surrounding peoples. They bowed down to them, and they provoked the Lord to anger.<br /><br />
They abandoned the Lord to serve Baal and Astarte.<br /><br />
Then the Lord’s anger flared against Israel. He delivered them into the hands of raiders, abandoned them to the enemies who surrounded them, and they were unable to resist them.<br /><br />
In all their expeditions, the hand of the Lord was against them, for their misfortune, as he had told them, as he had sworn. They were in very great distress.<br /><br />
Then the Lord raised up judges to save them from the hand of the raiders.<br /><br />
But they did not obey their judges either. They prostituted themselves by following other gods, they bowed down before them. They were quick to turn aside from the path where their fathers had walked in obeying the Lord’s commandments; they did not act like them.<br /><br />
When the Lord raised up a judge for them, the Lord was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies as long as the judge was alive; for the Lord was moved with compassion when they groaned under the violence of their oppressors.<br /><br />
But when the judge died, they would again relapse and be more corrupt than their fathers: they would follow other gods, serve them and bow down before them; they would not renounce any of their practices or their stubborn conduct.<br />

Psalm <font dir="ltr">106(105),6.35.36-37.39-40.43ab.44.</font><br />With our fathers, we have sinned,<br /><br />
we have failed and disowned.<br /><br />
they mingle with the pagans,<br /><br />
they learn their ways.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Then they serve their idols,<br /><br />
and for them it is a snare:<br /><br />
they offer their sons and their daughters<br /><br />
in sacrifice to demons.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Such practices defile them;<br /><br />
they prostitute themselves through such actions.<br /><br />
And the Lord's anger burns against his people:<br /><br />
his inheritance fills him with revulsion.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So many times delivered by God,<br /><br />
they persist in their own ideas,<br /><br />
and he sees their distress<br /><br />
when he hears their cries.<br />
