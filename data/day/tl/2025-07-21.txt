The Sign of Jonah@@@@@<br />
      Behold, the flight of the prophet Jonah away from God (Jonah 1:3) is transformed into a prophetic image, and what is presented as a tragic shipwreck becomes the sign of the Lord’s resurrection. The very text of the story of Jonah clearly shows how he fully embodies the image of the Savior. It is written that Jonah “fled from the face of God.” To take on the condition and face of man, did not the Lord himself flee the condition and aspect of divinity? Thus says the Apostle Paul: “He, who was in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant” (Phil 2:6-7). He who is Lord took on the condition of a servant; to pass unnoticed in the world, to be victorious over the devil, he fled from himself in man… God is everywhere: it is impossible to flee from him; to “flee from the face of God,” not in a place but somehow by aspect, Christ took refuge in the face of our fully assumed servitude.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
      The text continues: “Jonah went down to Joppa to flee to Tarshish.” He who descends, behold him: “No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven” (Jn 3:13). The Lord descended from heaven to earth, God descended to man, omnipotence descended to our servitude. But Jonah, who was descending to the ship, had to board it to travel; so Christ, having descended into this world, ascended, by his virtues and miracles, into the ship of his Church.<br />

Book of Exodus 14:5-18.@@@@@In those days, it was announced to the king of Egypt that the people of Israel had fled. Then Pharaoh and his servants changed their minds about this people. They said: “What have we done in letting Israel go: they will no longer serve us!”<br /><br />
Pharaoh had his chariot hitched and his troops gathered;<br /><br />
he took six hundred elite chariots and all the chariots of Egypt, each with its crew.<br /><br />
The Lord made Pharaoh, king of Egypt, obstinate, and he pursued the sons of Israel, while they went out freely.<br /><br />
The Egyptians, all Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, warriors, and army, pursued them and overtook them as they camped by the sea, near Pi-Hahiroth, opposite Baal-Zephon.<br /><br />
As Pharaoh approached, the sons of Israel looked up and, seeing the Egyptians pursuing them, they were very afraid, and they cried out to the Lord.<br /><br />
They said to Moses: “Was Egypt lacking in tombs, that you have brought us to die in the wilderness? What a bad service you have rendered us by bringing us out of Egypt!<br /><br />
This is what we told you in Egypt: “Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians. It is better to serve them than to die in the wilderness!””<br /><br />
Moses answered the people: “Do not be afraid! Stand firm! You will see today what the Lord will do to save you! For, these Egyptians whom you see today, you will never see them again.<br /><br />
The Lord will fight for you, and you, you will have nothing to do.”<br /><br />
The Lord said to Moses: “Why do you cry out to me? Command the sons of Israel to set out!<br /><br />
You, lift up your staff, stretch out your hand over the sea, divide it in two, and let the sons of Israel enter the midst of the sea on dry ground.<br /><br />
And I, I will make the Egyptians obstinate: they will enter after them; I will gain glory over Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and his warriors.<br /><br />
The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord, when I have gained glory over Pharaoh, his chariots and his warriors.”<br />

Book of Exodus 15:1.2.3-4a.4b-5.6.@@@@@I will sing to the Lord!<br /><br />
Glorious is his triumph:<br /><br />
he has hurled into the sea<br /><br />
horse and rider!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Lord is my strength and my song:<br /><br />
he has become my salvation.<br /><br />
He is my God, I will praise him;<br /><br />
I will exalt the God of my father.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Lord is a warrior;<br /><br />
the Lord is his name.<br /><br />
Pharaoh’s chariots and his armies,<br /><br />
he has cast into the sea.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The elite of their charioteers are drowned in the Red Sea.<br /><br />
The deep waters cover them:<br /><br />
they sank, like a stone,<br /><br />
to the depths of the waters.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Your right hand, O Lord,<br /><br />
majestic in power,<br /><br />
your right hand, O Lord,<br /><br />
shatters the enemy.<br />

Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew 12:38-42.@@@@@At that time, some of the scribes and Pharisees spoke to Jesus: “Teacher, we would like to see a sign from you.”<br /><br />
He answered them: “This evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.<br /><br />
For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.<br /><br />
At the Judgment, the people of Nineveh will rise up with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.<br /><br />
At the Judgment, the Queen of Sheba will rise up with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.”<br />
